You need to download NLP package from http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/ before running this code.
How code works ?

•	Run CollectData class. Enter input folder value as folder name (Only name) where all source (set of registered) documents resides.  Source folder should be present where java code resides. It will create all sub-indexes.

•	Run GenerateIndex class. It will create MergeOut_* files in folder where java code resides.

•	Run DetectPlagiarism class. Enter MergeOut_* folder name with highest index. This folder would be created where java code resides after runnin GenerateIndex class. 
•	Enter suspicious folder name and suspicious file name.
