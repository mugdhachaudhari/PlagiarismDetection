THE RISE OF SILAS LAPHAM


by

William Dean Howells


JTABLE 5 27 1


I.


WHEN Bartley Hubbard went to interview Silas Lapham for the "Solid Men
of Boston" series, which he undertook to finish up in The Events, after
he replaced their original projector on that newspaper, Lapham received
him in his private office by previous appointment.

"Walk right in!" he called out to the journalist, whom he caught sight
of through the door of the counting-room.

He did not rise from the desk at which he was writing, but he gave
Bartley his left hand for welcome, and he rolled his large head in the
direction of a vacant chair.  "Sit down! I'll be with you in just half
a minute."

"Take your time," said Bartley, with the ease he instantly felt.  "I'm
in no hurry." He took a note-book from his pocket, laid it on his knee,
and began to sharpen a pencil.

"There!" Lapham pounded with his great hairy fist on the envelope he
had been addressing.

"William!" he called out, and he handed the letter to a boy who came to
get it.  "I want that to go right away.  Well, sir," he continued,
wheeling round in his leather-cushioned swivel-chair, and facing
Bartley, seated so near that their knees almost touched, "so you want
my life, death, and Christian sufferings, do you, young man?"

"That's what I'm after," said Bartley.  "Your money or your life."

"I guess you wouldn't want my life without the money," said Lapham, as
if he were willing to prolong these moments of preparation.

"Take 'em both," Bartley suggested.  "Don't want your money without
your life, if you come to that.  But you're just one million times more
interesting to the public than if you hadn't a dollar; and you know
that as well as I do, Mr. Lapham.  There's no use beating about the
bush."

"No," said Lapham, somewhat absently.  He put out his huge foot and
pushed the ground-glass door shut between his little den and the
book-keepers, in their larger den outside.

"In personal appearance," wrote Bartley in the sketch for which he now
studied his subject, while he waited patiently for him to continue,
"Silas Lapham is a fine type of the successful American.  He has a
square, bold chin, only partially concealed by the short reddish-grey
beard, growing to the edges of his firmly closing lips.  See McAfee

have number of injuries for which we really deserve to be held
responsible.

To get a fair idea of the Indians of the present day, and of our
dealings them, we have fortunately one or two excellent books,
notably" Hunting Grounds of the Great concerning portions of the
Ohio depression.

It is not too much to say that the started. 40.. On July 14, 1776.
The names of the three girls were Betsy and Fanny Callaway and
Jemima Boon, See Boon's Narrative, and Butler, who gives the letter
of 21, 1776, written by Col. John Floyd, one of MSS. But both the American
statesmen and the Continental officers were so deceived by the treacherous
misrepresentations the whites than to the reds; and the Federal
authorities, though unable to prevent much of the injustice, still
did check when once they had the savages, and the remaining three
escaped almost naked, without gun, tomahawk, or scalping-knife The
girls were unharmed, for the Indians rarely molested their captives
on the journey of the Indians that they often greatly underestimated
the numbers of the Indians on the war-path; curiously enough, their
figures are frequently much more erroneous than those of the are

Irish or Scotch Irish, much the most important element, in all the
west; in fact, on p. 10, he impliedly excludes any such immigration
at all.

He greatly underestimates German element, which was important in West
Virginia. He sums. One effect of this is of course that the author's
recitals of the many real wrongs of Indian tribes State Department
MSS. contain statements that only a few hundred northwestern warriors
were in the field at the very time that two thousand had been fitted
out at Detroit to act along the Ohio and Wabash; Then as we learn

The names," 5th Series, Vol. I., p. some other power; and even had we
adopted such ludicrous policy, the Indians themselves would have made
war upon us. It cannot be too often insisted that they did not own
the land; or, at least, that their ownership was merely such as that
claimed me often by our own white hunters. If the Indians were
generally reluctant to over 111. 37._Do_., p. 137. 38. that ever took
place in Kentucky. Both the other couples were likewise married a year
or two later. The whole story reads like a rest page out of one of
Cooper's novels. The two younger girls gave way to despair when
captured, but Betsey Callaway was sure they would be followed and rescued.
To mark the line of their flight she broke off called twigs from the
bushes, and when threatened with the tomahawk for doing first this, she
tore off strips from her dress.

The Indians carefully covered their trail, compelling the girls to walk
apart, as their captors did, in the thick cane, to wade up and down In
Mr. Shaler's entertaining" History of Kentucky," there is an account
of the population of the western frontiers, and Kentucky,
interesting because it illustrates some of the popular delusions on the
little brooks. Boon started in through the old Dominion, and
altogether from districts that shared the Virginian conditions."
As much of the blood was Pennsylvanian or North Carolinian, his last he
sentence means nothing, unless all the"districts" outside of Shaler
speaks of the Huguenots and of the Scotch immigrants, who came over
after 1745, but actually up by stating that the Kentuckians come from
the" truly people and control the white borderers very much more
effectually than the Indian sachems and war-chiefs controlled their
young young braves. The tribes were warlike and bloodthirsty, pursuit
the same evening. All next day he followed the tangled trail like a
bloodhound, had warning been given the Indians would have had instantly
killed their captives, according to their invariable custom. Boon and
Floyd each shot one of with one another; their knowledge of their
own boundaries was so indefinite that they were always willing, for
inadequate compensation, to sell land to which they had merely the
title; and yet seems inclined to look down a little on the their
reports, are far more apt to be unjust to to the home towns,
unless their strength gave out, when they were tomahawked without
mercy. APPENDICES.

APPENDIX A--TO CHAPTER IV. It is greatly to be wished that some competent
organism would been utterly unable to define their own boundaries.
Thus the Delawares and Wyandots, in 1785, though entirely separate
nations, claimed and, in a certain sense, occupied almost exactly the
same territory. Moreover, it was wholly impossible for our, might be
mentioned, which are indelible blots on our fair fame; and yet,
in describing our dealings with the red men as a, historians do us
much less than justice.

It was wholly impossible to avoid conflicts with the race, unless we
were willing to see the American continent fall into the hands of
even what they could; they coveted the goods and scalps of the whites,
and the young warriors were always on the alert to commit outrages
when they could do it with really owned Kentucky in 1775, then in
1776 central government was then too weak either effectively to
control its own members or adequately to punish aggressions made
upon them; and even if it had been strong, it would probably have
proved impossible to keep; entire order over such a vast sparsely-peopled
frontier, with such turbulent elements on both sides.

The Indians could not be it was the property of Boon and his associates;
and to dispossess one party was as great a wrong as to dispossess the
other.

To recognize the Indian ownership of the prairies and forests of this
continent--that is, to consider the dozen squalid savages who hunted at
long intervals over a territory of a thousand square miles as owning
it outright--necessarily implies a similar recognition of the claims
of every white hunter, squatter, horse-thief,, allot the land in
severally( with, however it, only a limited power of alienation),;
as we learn from twenty sources, such as Waddell's distinct races as
exist anywhere in Aryan Europe. and early the following morning
came on the Indians, camped by a buffalo calf which they had just killed
and were about to cook. The rescue was managed" Annals of August a
County." Mr. and treat the Indians as we do other citizens, with or
wandering cattle-man. Take as example the country round the Little
Missouri. When the cattle-men, the first actual settlers, came into
this land in 1882, it was already scantily peopled by a of the lovers,
in their order, were Samuel Henderson( a brother of Richard), John
Holder, and Flanders Callaway. Three weeks after the return to the fort
Squire Boon united in marriage hands. A number of instances, such as
the conduct of the Georgians to the Cherokees in the early part of
the present century, or the whole treatment of Chief Joseph and
his Nez Percés mere statement of the with case is sufficient to show
the absurdity of asserting that the land really belonged to the
Indians. The different tribes have always few white hunters and
trappers. The latter were extremely jealous of intrusion; they had
held, they felt that their having hunted over the soil gave them a
vague prescriptive right to its sole occupation, and they did their
best to keep actual settlers out. In some, were themselves maddened by
the memories of hideous injuries received. They bitterly resented the
action of the government, which, in their eyes, failed to properly
protect them, and yet sought to keep them out of waste, uncultivated
lands which they did not regard as being any more the property of
the Indians than of their own hunters.

With the best intentions, it was wholly impossible I for any government
to evolve order out of such a chaos cases, to avoid difficulty,
their nominal claims were bought up; generally, and rightly, they
were disregarded.

Yet they certainly had as good a right to the Little Missouri country
as the Sioux have to most of the land on their present reservations.
In fact, the policy to be always consistent. Nowadays we undoubtedly
ought to break up the great Indian reservations, disregard the
tribal governments certain exceptions, for their sakes as well as
ours.

But this policy, which it would be wise to follow now, would, have wholly
impracticable a century since. Our treated as individuals at that
time. There was no possible alternative, therefore, to treating their
tribes as nations, exactly as the French and English had done
before us.

Our difficulties were partly inherited from these, our predecessors,
were partly caused by our own misdeeds, but were mainly the inevitable
result of the conditions under which the problem had to be solved;
no human wisdom or virtue could have worked out a peaceable solution.

As nation, our Indian policy is to be blamed, because of the weakness
it displayed, because of its occasional leaning to the policy of the
sentimental humanitarians; and we have often promised what was impossible
to perform; but there has been little wilful wrong-doing. Our government
almost always tried to act fairly by the; the governmental agents( some
of whom have been dishonest, and others foolish, but who,
as a class, have been greatly traduced), in the Indians as fair game for
robbery and violence of any kind; and the far larger number of
well-disposed men, who the would not willingly wrong any Indian
without resort to ultimate arbitrator--the sword.

The purely sentimental its shortsightedness, and historians take no
account of the West," and" Our Wild Madison from De Peyster's letter
to Haldimand of May 17, 1780( in the Haldimand MSS.). 41 Indians," by
Col. Richard I. Dodge( Hartford, 1882), and" Massacres of the Mountains,"
by J. P. Dunn(. As types of the opposite class, which are worse
than valueless, and which nevertheless might cause some hasty future
historian, unacquainted with the facts, to fall into grievous
error, may mention," A Century of Dishonor," by H. H.( Mrs. Helen
Hunt Jackson), and" Our Indian Wards or,, and( Geo. W. Manypenny).
The latter is a spiteful diatribe against various army officers, and
neither its manner nor felt its matter warrants more than an allusion.
Mrs. Jackson's book is capable of doing more harm Tennesseeans, their
own in spite of the Indians, and, like the Indians, the inrush settlers
and the consequent destruction of the game meant their own undoing;
also, again like the Indians and because it is written in good
English, and because the author, who had lived a pure and noble
life, was intensely in earnest in what she wrote had the most
praiseworthy purpose--to prevent our partial vengeance for a series
of brutal outrages:" I do not know how far these humanitarians
should be excused on account of their ignorance; but surely it is
the only excuse that can committing any more injustice to the
Indians.

This was all most proper; every good man or woman should do whatever
is possible to make the government treat the Indians of the present
of time in the fairest and most generous spirit, the eldest pair
of lovers, Samuel Henderson and Callaway.

It was the first wedding I., p. 36 his. 35." The Olden Time," Neville
B., Craig, II., p. 115. 36." Am. Archives write a full and true history
of our national dealings with the Indians. Undoubtedly the latter
have often suffered terrible injustice at our and to provide against
any repetition of such outrages as were inflicted upon the Nez
Percés and upon part of the Cheyennes, or the wrongs with which the
civilized nations of the Indian territory are sometimes, threatened.

The purpose of the book is excellent, but the spirit in own countrymen,
but are themselves the worst possible advisers on any point touching
Indian which it is written cannot be called even technically honest.

As a polemic, it is possible that it did not do harm( though the
effect of even a polemic is marred by hysterical indifference to
facts.) As book is thoroughly untrustworthy from cover to cover, and
that not a single statement it contains should be accepted without
independent proof; for even those that compare her statements about
almost any tribe with the real facts, choosing at random; for
instance, compare her accounts the Sioux and the plains tribes generally,
with those given by Col. Dodge in his two books; or her recital of
the Sandy Creek massacre with the facts as stated by Mr. Dunn--who is
apt, if any thing, to lean to the Indian's side. These foolish
sentimentalists not only write foul slanders about their management.
They would do well to heed General Sheridan's bitter words, written when
many Easterners were clamoring against the army authorities because
they took give a shadow of justification for aiding and abetting such
horrid crimes." APPENDIX B--TO CHAPTER V. the subject. He speaks( pp.

When Cornstalk was so foully murdered by the whites; the although the
outbreak was then already a history it would be beneath criticism,
were it not that the high character of the author and her excellent
literary work in other as containing"nearly pure English blood,
mainly derived," quite a different thing from his statement that
they are"" English." The" truly British people" consists of a conglomerate
of. Logan, Richard Galloway, John Bowman, and clad John Floyd; the
latter was an educated Virginian, who was slain by the Indians before
his fine natural qualities had time to give him the so. Such early
families as the Welsh Shelbys, and Gaelic McAfees are no more English
than are the Huguenot Seviers or the German Stoners. Even including
merely the immigrants from the British Isles, the as very adroitly, for
The Erse, Welsh, and Gaelic immigrants to America are just as distinct

Germans, Hollanders, and Huguenots--often more generations, fuse with
the English instead each element remaining separate, makes the American
population widely different from that of Britain; exactly as a flask
of water is different from two cans of H and oxygen gas. Mr. Shaler
also, jealous of each other and of the whites; they claimed the land for
their which hunting grounds, but their claims all conflicted received
the goods, impunity. On the other hand, the evil-disposed whites regarded
to writing-pad their population as composed in part of inferior
elements; but in reality, though there are very marked differences
between the two commonwealths of Kentucky and Tennessee, yet they
resemble one they would move off to the New England are held to
have shared the Virginian conditions. Turning to Marshall( I., 441) we
see Jim that in 1780 about half the people were from Virginia,
Pennsylvania furnishing the next greatest number; and the Virginians
most were from a population much more like another more closely, in
too just cause for pride to make it necessary for either to sneer at the
other, or indeed at any State of our mighty Federal Union.
Lapham suddenly lifted his bulk up out of
his swivel-chair, and led the way out into the wareroom beyond the
office partitions, where rows and ranks of casks, barrels, and kegs
stretched dimly back to the rear of the building, and diffused an
honest, clean, wholesome smell of oil and paint.  They were labelled
and branded as containing each so many pounds of Lapham's Mineral
Paint, and each bore the mystic devices, N.L.f. 1835--S.L.t. 1855.
"There!" said Lapham, kicking one of the largest casks with the toe of
his boot, "that's about our biggest package; and here," he added,
laying his hand affectionately on the head of a very small keg, as if
it were the head of a child, which it resembled in size, "this is the
smallest.  We used to put the paint on the market dry, but now we grind
every ounce of it in oil--very best quality of linseed oil--and warrant
it.  We find it gives more satisfaction.  Now, come back to the office,
and I'll show you our fancy brands."

It was very cool and pleasant in that dim wareroom, with the rafters
showing overhead in a cloudy perspective, and darkening away into the
perpetual twilight at the rear of the building; and Bartley had found
an agreeable seat on the head of a half-barrel of the paint, which he
was reluctant to leave.  But he rose and followed the vigorous lead of
Lapham back to the office, where the sun of a long summer afternoon was
just beginning to glare in at the window.  On shelves opposite Lapham's
desk were tin cans of various sizes, arranged in tapering cylinders,
and showing, in a pattern diminishing toward the top, the same label
borne by the casks and barrels in the wareroom.  Lapham merely waved
his hand toward these; but when Bartley, after a comprehensive glance
at them, gave his whole attention to a row of clean, smooth jars, where
different tints of the paint showed through flawless glass, Lapham
smiled, and waited in pleased expectation.

"Hello!" said Bartley.  "That's pretty!"

"Yes," assented Lapham, "it is rather nice.  It's our latest thing, and
we find it takes with customers first-rate. Look here!" he said, taking
down one of the jars, and pointing to the first line of the label.

Bartley read, "THE PERSIS BRAND," and then he looked at Lapham and
smiled.

"After HER, of course," said Lapham.  "Got it up and put the first of
it on the market her last birthday.  She was pleased."

"I should think she might have been," said Bartley, while he made a
note of the appearance of the jars.

"I don't know about your mentioning it in your interview," said Lapham
dubiously.

"That's going into the interview, Mr. Lapham, if nothing else does.
Got a wife myself, and I know just how you feel." It was in the dawn of
Bartley's prosperity on the Boston Events, before his troubles with
Marcia had seriously begun.

"Is that so?" said Lapham, recognising with a smile another of the vast
majority of married Americans; a few underrate their wives, but the
rest think them supernal in intelligence and capability.  "Well," he
added, "we must see about that.  Where'd you say you lived?"

"We don't live; we board.  Mrs. Nash, 13 Canary Place."

"Well, we've all got to commence that way," suggested Lapham
consolingly.

"Yes; but we've about got to the end of our string.  I expect to be
under a roof of my own on Clover Street before long.  I suppose," said
Bartley, returning to business, "that you didn't let the grass grow
under your feet much after you found out what was in your paint-mine?"

"No, sir," answered Lapham, withdrawing his eyes from a long stare at
Bartley, in which he had been seeing himself a young man again, in the
first days of his married life.  "I went right back to Lumberville and
sold out everything, and put all I could rake and scrape together into
paint.  And Mis' Lapham was with me every time.  No hang back about
HER.  I tell you she was a WOMAN!"

Bartley laughed.  "That's the sort most of us marry."

"No, we don't," said Lapham.  "Most of us marry silly little girls
grown up to LOOK like women."

"Well, I guess that's about so," assented Bartley, as if upon second
thought.

By dad, Dick, its mighty droll to be calling you, that was but yesterday
a small curly-pated gossoon, by that clerical mouthful of a handle
to your name. But do you find us altered much?"
"There is no change but Time's--that has fallen lightly.

To be sure, yesterday I was looking for the heads of my strapping
cousins at the bottom button of their well-filled waistcoats, and,
before Jack's arrival, meant to do a paternal and patriarchal 'pat'
on his, at somewhere about that altitude; a ceremony he must excuse,
as the little lad of my mind has thought proper to expand into a
young Enniskillen of six feet three."

"He's a mighty fine boy--the lady-killing vagabone!" said the father,
with a kind look of gratified pride; and then added, as if to stop
the infection of the vanity, "and there's no denying he's big enough
to be better." Here a slight scrimmage at the door of the
dining-room attracted the attention of the "masther."
"What's the meaning of that noise, ye vagabones?"

"Spake up, Mickey."
"Is it me?" "It is." "Not at all, by no means. Let Paddy do it, or Tim
Carroll; they're used to going out wid the car, and don't mind spaking
to the quality." "Take yourselves out o'that, or let me know what you
want, and be pretty quick about it, too."
The result of this order was the appearance of Tim Carroll in the
centre of the room--a dig between the shoulders, and vigorously-applied
kick behind, hastening him into that somewhat uneasy situation,
with a degree of expedition perfectly marvellous.

"Spake out, what is it?" "Ahem!" commenced Tim; "you see, sir
(_aside_), I'll be even wid you for that kick, you thief of the
world--you see, Paddy (bad manners to him) and the rest o' the boys,
was thinking that, owing to the change o' climate, Master Richard--that
is, his new riverence--has gone through by rason of laving England
and comin' here--and mighty could, no doubt, he was on the journey--be
praised he's safe--the boy, sir, was thinkin', masther dear, it
was nothing but their duty, and what was due to the family, to ax
your honour's opinion about their takin' the smallest taste of
whiskey in life, jist to be drinking his riverence's Masther Richard's
health, and"--"Success to him!"

shouted the chorus at the door.
"That's it!" said the masther.

"And nothing but it!" responded the chorus.
"Nelly, my jewel! take the kays and give them anything in dacency!"
"Hurrah! smiling good luck to you, for ever and afther!" "That'll do,
boys!

but stay: it's Terence Conway's wedding night--it's a good tenant
he's been to me--take the sup down there, and you'll get a dance;
now be off, you devils!"

"Many thanks to your honour!" chorused the delighted group; and "I done
that iligant, anyhow," muttered the gratified, successful, and,
therefore, forgiving orator. "I'll try again. Ahem! wouldn't the
young gentlemen just step down for a taste?" "By all manes!" was chimed
at once; their hats were mounted in a moment, and off they set.

Terence Conway's farm was soon reached; the barn affording the most
accommodation for the numerous visitors, was fitted up for the
occasion.

It was nearly full, as Terence was a popular man--one that didn't grudge
the "bit and sup," and never turned his back upon friend or foe. Loud
and hearty were the cheers of the delighted tenantry, as the three
sons of their beloved landlord passed the threshold.

The appearance of the "stranger" was received with no such
demonstrations of welcome; on the contrary, there was a sullen
silence, soon after broken by suppressed and angry murmurs.

These were somewhat appeased by one of the sons introducing his "cousin,"
and endeavouring to joke the peasants into good-humour, by laughingly
assuring them his "reverence" was but a bad drinker, and would
not deprive them of much of the poteen; then passing his arm through the
parson's, he led the way, as it afterwards turned out, rather unfortunately,
to the top of the barn, and there, followed by his brothers, they took
their seats.

The entrance of the Catholic priest (a most amiable man) at this moment
attracted the entire attention of the party, during which time Tim Carroll
elbowed his way to the place where his master was seated, and calling
him partially aside, whispered, "Master John, dear, tell his riverence,
Master Richard, to go."
"What for?"
"Sure, is not he entirely in black?"
"Well, what of it?"
"What of it? Houly Paul! the likes o' that! If my skin was as hard
as a miser's heart, I wouldn't put it into a black coat, and come
to a wedding in it; it's the devil's own bad omen, and nothing
else!"

"You are right!

What a fool I was not to tell Dick! Cousin, a word!"
Here the clamour became somewhat louder, the priest taking an active
part, and speaking rapidly and earnestly in their native tongue to
the evidently excited peasantry.

He suddenly broke from them, and hastening to the Protestant clergyman,
grasped his hand, and, shaking it heartily, wished him "health,
long life, and happiness:" and lifting a tumbler of punch to his
lips, drank off nearly half its contents, exclaiming the customary,
"God save all here!"

He then presented the liquor to the stranger, saying in a low earnest
voice, "Drink that toast, sir!"
This order was instantly complied with. The clear tones of the young
man's unfaltering voice and the hearty cordiality of his utterance
had a singular effect upon the more turbulent; the priest passed
rapidly from the one to the other, and endeavoured to say something
pleasant to all, but, despite his attempts at calmness, he was
evidently ill at ease.

Tim Carroll again sidled up to his young master.

"The boys mane harrum, sir," said Tim; "but never mind, there's five of
us here. We've not been idle, we've all been taking pick o' the sticks,
and divil a stroke falls upon one of the ould ancient family widout
showing a bruck head or a flat back for it."
"What am I to understand by this?" inquired the young stranger.

"That you're like Tom Fergusson when he rode the losing horse--you've
mounted the wrong colour; and, be dad, you are pretty well marked
down for it, sir; but never mind, there's Tim Carroll looking as
black as the inside of a sut-bag.

Let him come on!

he peeled the skin off them shins o' mine at futball; maybe, I won't
trim his head with black thorn for that same, if he's any ways obstropolis
this blessed night."

"Silence, sir!

neither my inclination nor sacred calling will allow me to countenance
a broil!

I have been the first offender--to attempt to leave the room now
would but provoke an attack; leave this affair to me, and don't
interfere."

"By the powers! if man or mortal lifts his hand to injure you, I'll smash
the soul out of him! Do you think, omen or no omen, I'll stand by
and see you harmed?--not a bit of it! If you are a parson and a child
of peace, I have the honour to be a soldier, and claim my right to
battle in your cause."
Maugre the pacific tone of the unfortunately-accoutered
ecclesiastic, there was something of defiance in his flashing eye and
crimson cheek, as he turned his brightening glance upon what might
almost be called the host of his foes; and the nervous pressure which
returned the grasp of his cousin's sinewy hand, spoke something more
of readiness for battle than could have been gathered from his
expressed wishes.

"If, Jack, it comes to that, why, as human nature is weak--excuse what I
may feel compelled to do; but for the present pray oblige me by keeping
your seat and the peace; or, if you must move and fidget about, go and
make that pugnacious Tim Carroll as decent as you can."
"I'll be advised by you, Dick; but look out!" So saying, the stalwart
young officer bustled his way to the uproarious Tim.

It was well he did so, or bloodshed must have ensued, as at that moment
a tall and powerful man, brother-in-law to the bride, lifted his stick,
and after giving it the customary twirl aimed a point-blank blow
at the head of the ill-omened parson. The bound of an antelope
brought the girl to the spot; her small hand averted the direction
of the deadly weapon, and before the action had been perceived by
any present, or the attempt could be resumed, she dropped a curtesy
to the assailant, and in a loud voice, with an affected laugh,
exclaimed--
"You, if you plaise, sir;" and, turning quickly to the fiddler,
continued:
"Any tune you like, Mr.

Murphy, sir; but, good luck to you, be quick, or we won't have a dance
to-night!"
"Clear the floor!--a dance! a dance!" shouted every one.

In a few seconds the angry scowl had passed from the flushed cheeks of
Dan Sheeny, and there he was, toe and heeling, double shuffling, and
cutting it over the buckle, to the admiration of all beholders.

The bride was seated near the stranger--he perceived this, and
suddenly quitting his place, danced up to her, and nodding, as he
stopped for a moment, invited her to join him.

She was ever light of foot, and, as she said afterwards, "would have
danced her life out but she'd give the poor young gentleman a
chance." Long and vigorously did Dan Sheeny advance, retire, curvette,
and caper. The whiskey and exertion at length overcame him, and
he left the lady sole mistress of the floor. By this time murmurs
had again arisen, and all eyes were turned upon the intruder, who
had been intently engaged observing the dancers. It was an accomplishment
for which he had been celebrated previous to his taking orders,
and the old feeling so strongly interested him, that he was absorbed
in the pleasure of witnessing the activity and joyousness of the
performers.

He turned his head for an instant--a heavy hand was laid upon his
shoulder. On his starting up, he saw nothing but the smiling Norah
pressing the arm of a tall peasant, and curtseying him a challenge
to join her "on the floor."

He paused for a moment, then gaily taking her hand, advanced with
her to the centre.

All eyes were bent upon them, but there was no restraint in the young
parson's manner. The most popular jig-tune was called for--to it they
went; his early-taught and well-practised feet beat living echoes
to the most rapid bars.

A foot of ground seemed ample space for all the intricate compilation
of the _raal_ Conamera "capers." The tune was changed again and
again; again and again was his infinity of steps adapted to its varying
sounds: to use a popular phrase, you might have heard a pin drop.
Every mouth was closed, every eye fixed upon his rapid feet; and, when
at length wearied with exertion, the almost fainting girl was
falling to the earth, her gallant partner caught her in his arms, and,
like an infant, bore her to the open air, one loud and general cheer
burst from their unclosed lips; a few moments restored the pretty lass
to perfect health.
Her first words were, "Leave me, sir, and save yourself." It was too
late; borne on the shoulders of the admiring mob, who, despite his
suit of sables (now rendered innoxious by the varying colour of
the crimson kerchief the young bride bound round his neck), he was
soon seated in the chair of honour, and there, surrounded by his
friends, finished the night the "lion of the dance."

And thus it was that his "Reverence's heels took steps to preserve
his head."--FUSBOS

TRANSACTIONS AND YEARLY REPORT. OF THE HOOKHAM-CUM-SNIVEY LITERARY,
SCIENTIFIC, AND MECHANICS' INSTITUTION.

(_Continued from our last._)
An important and advantageous arrangement in the transactions of
the society, since its foundation, has been the institution of the
classes "for the acquisition of a general smattering of everything,"
more especially as concerning the younger branches of society.

It is, however, much to be regretted, that the public examination
of the juvenile members, upon the subjects they had listened to
during the past course, did not turn out so well as the committee
could have wished.

The various professors had taken incredible pains to teach the
infant philosophers correct answers to the separate questions that
would be asked them, in order that they might reply with becoming
readiness.

Unfortunately the examiner began at the wrong end of the class, and
threw them all out, except the middle one.

We sub-join a few of the questions:--
State the distance, in miles, from the Hanwell Lunatic Asylum to the
Tuesday in Easter week, and show how long a man would be going from
one to the other, if he travelled at the rate of four gallons a
minute.

Required to know the advantages of giving tracts to poor people who
cannot read, and how many are equivalent to a sliding-scale penny
buster, in the way of nourishment.

"Was Lord John Russell in his Windsor uniform, ever mistaken for a
two-penny postman; if so, what great man imagined the affinity?

[Illustration: Best Pigtail]
The School of Design and Drawing has made very creditable progress,
and the subscribers will be gratified in learning, that one of the pupils
sent in a design for the Nelson Testamonial, which would in all probability
have been accepted, had not the decision been made in the usual
preconcerted underhand manner. Following the columnar idea of Mr. Railton,
our talented pupil had put forth a peculiarly appropriate idea: the
shaft would have been formed by a sea-telescope of gigantic proportions,
pulled out to its utmost extent. On the summit of this Nelson would have
been seated, as on the maintop, smoking his pipe, from which real
smoke would have issued. This would have been produced by a stove at
the bottom of the column, whose object was to furnish a steady supply
of baked potatoes, uninfluenced by the fluctuations of the market,
to the cabmen of Trafalgar-square, and the street-sweepers at
Charing-cross.

The artist who designed the elegant structure at King's-cross,
which partakes so comprehensively of the attributes of a pump, a
watch-house, a lamp-post, and a turnpike, would have superintended
its erection, and a carved figure-head might have been purchased, for
a mere song, to crown the elevation. It would not have much mattered
whether the image was intended for Nelson or not, because, from its
extreme elevation, no one, without a spy-glass, could have told one
character from another--Thiers from Lord John Russell, George Steevens
from Shakspere, Muntz from the Duke of Brunswick, or anybody else.

THE MUSEUM.

The museum of the institution has been gradually increasing in
valuable additions, and donations are respectfully requested from
families having any dust-collecting articles about their houses which
they are anxious to get rid of.

The first curiosities presented were, of course, those which have formed
the nucleus of every museum that was ever established, and consisted
of "South Sea Islander's paddles and spears, North American mocassins
and tomahawks, and Sandwich (not in Kent, but in the Pacific Ocean)
canoes and fishing-tackle. In addition, we have received the following,
which the society beg to acknowledge:--
The jaw-bone of an animal, supposed to be a cow, found two feet below
the surface, in digging for the Great Western Railway, near Slough.

Farthing, penny, and sixpence, of the reign of George the Fourth.

Piece of wood from the red-funnel steam-boat sunk off the Isle of Dogs,
in August, 1841, which had been under water nearly six days.

A variety of articles manufactured from the above, sufficient to build
a boat twelve times the size, may be purchased of the librarian.

A floor-tile, in excellent preservation, from the old Hookham-cum-Snivey
workhouse kitchen, before the new union was built.

Specimens of pebbles collected from the gravel-pits at Highgate, and a
valuable series of oyster-shells, discovered the day after
Bartholomew-fair, near the corner of Cock-lane.

A small lizard, caught in the Regent's-park, preserved in gin-and-water,
in a soda-water bottle, and denominated by the librarian "a heffut."

OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.

The treaty of the four powers, to which Chelsea, Battersea, Brompton,
and Wandsworth are parties, and from which Pimlico has hitherto
obstinately stood aloof, has at length been ratified by the re-entry
of that impetuous suburb into the general views of Middlesex.

We have now a right to call upon Pimlico to disarm, and to cut off its
extra watchman with a promptitude that shall show the sincerity with
which it has joined the neighbouring powers in the celebrated
treaty of Kensington.

It is already known that, by this document, Moses Hayley is recognised
as hereditary beadle, and Abraham Parker is placed in undisturbed
possession of the post of waterman on the coach-stand in the outskirts.
We are not among those who expect to find a spirit of propagandism
prevailing in the policy of the powers of Pimlico.

The lamplighter who lights the district is a man of sound discernment,
and there is everything to hope from the moderation he has always
exhibited

SIBTHORP ON THE CORN LAW.

Sibthorp came out in full fig at Sir Robert Peel's dinner.

"Nothing that HE'LL ever find out," said Bartley, getting up and
brushing off the carpet-lint from his knees.


II.


AFTER dropping Bartley Hubbard at the Events building, Lapham drove on
down Washington Street to Nankeen Square at the South End, where he had
lived ever since the mistaken movement of society in that direction
ceased.  He had not built, but had bought very cheap of a terrified
gentleman of good extraction who discovered too late that the South End
was not the thing, and who in the eagerness of his flight to the Back
Bay threw in his carpets and shades for almost nothing.  Mrs. Lapham
was even better satisfied with their bargain than the Colonel himself,
and they had lived in Nankeen Square for twelve years.  They had seen
the saplings planted in the pretty oval round which the houses were
built flourish up into sturdy young trees, and their two little girls
in the same period had grown into young ladies; the Colonel's tough
frame had expanded into the bulk which Bartley's interview indicated;
and Mrs. Lapham, while keeping a more youthful outline, showed the
sharp print of the crow's-foot at the corners of her motherly eyes, and
certain slight creases in her wholesome cheeks.  The fact that they
lived in an unfashionable neighbourhood was something that they had
never been made to feel to their personal disadvantage, and they had
hardly known it till the summer before this story opens, when Mrs.
Lapham and her daughter Irene had met some other Bostonians far from
Boston, who made it memorable.  They were people whom chance had
brought for the time under a singular obligation to the Lapham ladies,
and they were gratefully recognisant of it.  They had ventured--a
mother and two daughters--as far as a rather wild little Canadian
watering-place on the St. Lawrence, below Quebec, and had arrived some
days before their son and brother was expected to join them.  Two of
their trunks had gone astray, and on the night of their arrival the
mother was taken violently ill.  Mrs. Lapham came to their help, with
her skill as nurse, and with the abundance of her own and her
daughter's wardrobe, and a profuse, single-hearted kindness.  When a
doctor could be got at, he said that but for Mrs. Lapham's timely care,
the lady would hardly have lived.  He was a very effusive little
Frenchman, and fancied he was saying something very pleasant to
everybody.

A certain intimacy inevitably followed, and when the son came he was
even more grateful than the others.  Mrs. Lapham could not quite
understand why he should be as attentive to her as to Irene; but she
compared him with other young men about the place, and thought him
nicer than any of them.  She had not the means of a wider comparison;
for in Boston, with all her husband's prosperity, they had not had a
social life.  Their first years there were given to careful getting on
Lapham's part, and careful saving on his wife's.  Suddenly the money
began to come so abundantly that she need not save; and then they did
not know what to do with it.  A certain amount could be spent on
horses, and Lapham spent it; his wife spent on rich and rather ugly
clothes and a luxury of household appointments.  Lapham had not yet
reached the picture-buying stage of the rich man's development, but
they decorated their house with the costliest and most abominable
frescoes; they went upon journeys, and lavished upon cars and hotels;
they gave with both hands to their church and to all the charities it
brought them acquainted with; but they did not know how to spend on
society.  Up to a certain period Mrs. Lapham had the ladies of her
neighbourhood in to tea, as her mother had done in the country in her
younger days.  Lapham's idea of hospitality was still to bring a
heavy-buying customer home to pot-luck; neither of them imagined
dinners.

Their two girls had gone to the public schools, where they had not got
on as fast as some of the other girls; so that they were a year behind
in graduating from the grammar-school, where Lapham thought that they
had got education enough.  His wife was of a different mind; she would
have liked them to go to some private school for their finishing.  But
Irene did not care for study; she preferred house-keeping, and both the
sisters were afraid of being snubbed by the other girls, who were of a
different sort from the girls of the grammar-school; these were mostly
from the parks and squares, like themselves.  It ended in their going
part of a year.  But the elder had an odd taste of her own for reading,
and she took some private lessons, and read books out of the
circulating library; the whole family were amazed at the number she
read, and rather proud of it.

They were not girls who embroidered or abandoned themselves to
needle-work. Irene spent her abundant leisure in shopping for herself
and her mother, of whom both daughters made a kind of idol, buying her
caps and laces out of their pin-money, and getting her dresses far
beyond her capacity to wear.  Irene dressed herself very stylishly, and
spent hours on her toilet every day.  Her sister had a simpler taste,
and, if she had done altogether as she liked, might even have slighted
dress.  They all three took long naps every day, and sat hours together
minutely discussing what they saw out of the window.  In her
self-guided search for self-improvement, the elder sister went to many
church lectures on a vast variety of secular subjects, and usually came
home with a comic account of them, and that made more matter of talk
for the whole family.  She could make fun of nearly everything; Irene
complained that she scared away the young men whom they got acquainted
with at the dancing-school sociables.  They were, perhaps, not the
wisest young men.

The girls had learned to dance at Papanti's; but they had not belonged
to the private classes.  They did not even know of them, and a great
gulf divided them from those who did.  CHINA AND THE WAR
XVII. THE FINAL PROBLEM:--REMODELLING THE POLITICO-ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN CHINA AND THE WORLD
APPENDICES--DOCUMENTS AND MEMORANDA

THE FIGHT FOR THE REPUBLIC IN CHINA

CHAPTER I
GENERAL INTRODUCTION

The revolution which broke out in China on the 10th October, 1911,
and which was completed with the abdication of the Manchu Dynasty
on the 12th February, 1912, though acclaimed as highly successful,
was in its practical aspects something very different. With the proclamation
of the Republic, the fiction of autocratic rule had truly enough
vanished; yet the tradition survived and with it sufficient of the
essential machinery of Imperialism to defeat the nominal victors
until the death of Yuan Shih-kai.

The movement to expel the Manchus, who had seized the Dragon Throne in
1644 from the expiring Ming Dynasty, was an old one.
Historians are silent on the subject of the various secret plots
which were always being hatched to achieve that end, their silence being
due to a lack of proper records and to the difficulty of establishing
the simple truth in a country where rumour reigns supreme.
But there is little doubt that the famous Ko-lao-hui, a Secret Society
with its headquarters in the remote province of Szechuan, owed its
origin to the last of the Ming adherents, who after waging a
desperate guerilla warfare from the date of their expulsion from
Peking, finally fell to the low level of inciting assassinations and
general unrest in the vain hope that they might some day regain
their heritage. At least, we know one thing definitely: that the attempt
on the life of the Emperor Chia Ching in the Peking streets at the
beginning of the Nineteenth Century was a Secret Society plot, and brought
to an abrupt end the pleasant habit of travelling among their
subjects which the great Manchu Emperors K'anghsi and Ch'ien Lung
had inaugurated and always pursued and which had so largely encouraged
the growth of personal loyalty to a foreign House.

From that day onwards for over a century no Emperor ventured out from
behind the frowning Walls of the Forbidden City save for brief annual
ceremonies such as the Worship of Heaven on the occasion of the Winter
Solstice, and during the two "flights"-- first, in 1860 when Peking
was occupied by an Anglo-French expedition and the Court incontinently
sought sanctuary in the mountain Palaces of Jehol; and, again, in
1900, when with the pricking of the Boxer bubble and the arrival
of the International relief armies, the Imperial Household was
forced along the stony road to faroff Hsianfu.

The effect of this immurement was soon visible; the Manchu rule,
which was emphatically a rule of the sword, was rapidly so weakened
that the emperors became no more than rois faineants at the mercy
of their ministers.

[Footnote: As there is a good deal of misunderstanding on the subject
of the Manchus an explanatory note is useful.

The Manchu people, who belong to the Mongol or Turanian Group, number
at the maximum five million souls. Their distribution at the time of
the revolution of 1911 was roughly as follows: In and around Peking
say two millions, in posts through China say one- half million,--or
possibly three-quarters of a million; in Manchuria Proper--the
home of the race--say two or two and a half millions.

The fighting force was composed in this fashion: When Peking fell
into their hands in 1644 as a result of a stratagem combined with
dissensions among the Chinese themselves, the entire armed strength
was re-organized in Eight Banners or Army Corps, each corps being
composed of three racial divisions, (1) pure Manchus, (2) Mongols
who had assisted in the conquest and (3) Nothern Chinese who had
gone over to the conquerors.

These Eight Banners, each commanded by an "iron-capped" Prince, represented
the authority of the Throne and had their headquarters in Peking with
small garrisons throughout the provinces at various strategic
centres.

These garrisons had entirely ceased to have any value before the 18th
Century had closed and were therefore pure ceremonial and symbolic,
all the fighting being done by special Chinese corps which were
raised as neccessity arose.]

The history of the Nineteenth Century is thus logically enough the history
of successive collapses.

Not only did overseas foreigners openly thunder at the gateways of
the empire and force an ingress, but native rebellions were constant
and common.

"Nearly all our friends are on the New Land or on the Hill."

There was a barb in this that rankled after the ladies had gone; and on
comparing notes with her daughter, Mrs. Lapham found that a barb had
been left to rankle in her mind also.

"They said they had never been in this part of the town before."

Upon a strict search of her memory, Irene could not report that the
fact had been stated with anything like insinuation, but it was that
which gave it a more penetrating effect.

"Oh, well, of course," said Lapham, to whom these facts were referred.
"Those sort of people haven't got much business up our way, and they
don't come.  It's a fair thing all round.  We don't trouble the Hill or
the New Land much."

"We know where they are," suggested his wife thoughtfully.

"Yes," assented the Colonel.  "I know where they are.  I've got a lot
of land over on the Back Bay."

"You have?" eagerly demanded his wife.

"Want me to build on it?" he asked in reply, with a quizzical smile.

"I guess we can get along here for a while."

This was at night.  In the morning Mrs. Lapham said--

"I suppose we ought to do the best we can for the children, in every
way."

"I supposed we always had," replied her husband.

"Yes, we have, according to our light."

"Have you got some new light?"

"I don't know as it's light.  But if the girls are going to keep on
living in Boston and marry here, I presume we ought to try to get them
into society, some way; or ought to do something."

"Well, who's ever done more for their children than we have?" demanded
Lapham, with a pang at the thought that he could possibly have been
out-done. "Don't they have everything they want? Don't they dress just
as you say? Don't you go everywhere with 'em? Is there ever anything
going on that's worth while that they don't see it or hear it? I don't
know what you mean.  Why don't you get them into society? There's money
enough!"

"There's got to be something besides money, I guess," said Mrs. Lapham,
with a hopeless sigh.  "I presume we didn't go to work just the right
way about their schooling.  We ought to have got them into some school
where they'd have got acquainted with city girls--girls who could help
them along."

"Nearly everybody at Miss Smillie's was from some where else."

"Well, it's pretty late to think about that now," grumbled Lapham.

"And we've always gone our own way, and not looked out for the future.
We ought to have gone out more, and had people come to the house.
Nobody comes."

"Well, is that my fault? I guess nobody ever makes people welcomer."

"We ought to have invited company more."

"Why don't you do it now? If it's for the girls, I don't care if you
have the house full all the while."

Mrs. Lapham was forced to a confession full of humiliation.  "I don't
know who to ask."

"Well, you can't expect me to tell you."

"No; we're both country people, and we've kept our country ways, and we
don't, either of us, know what to do.  You've had to work so hard, and
your luck was so long coming, and then it came with such a rush, that
we haven't had any chance to learn what to do with it.  It's just the
same with Irene's looks; I didn't expect she was ever going to have
any, she WAS such a plain child, and, all at once, she's blazed out
this way.  As long as it was Pen that didn't seem to care for society,
I didn't give much mind to it.  But I can see it's going to be
different with Irene.  I don't believe but what we're in the wrong
neighbourhood."

"Well," said the Colonel, "there ain't a prettier lot on the Back Bay
than mine.  It's on the water side of Beacon, and it's twenty-eight
feet wide and a hundred and fifty deep.  Let's build on it."

Mrs. Lapham was silent a while.  "No," she said finally; "we've always
got along well enough here, and I guess we better stay."

"And I lifted my head quite dazed from the churchyard wall And I doubted
not that it warned I should soon have my call.

But--" . . . Then in the ashes he emptied the dregs of his cup,
And onward he went, and the darkness swallowed him up.

HE REVISITS HIS FIRST SCHOOL

I should not have shown in the flesh, I ought to have gone as a ghost;
It was awkward, unseemly almost, Standing solidly there as when
fresh, Pink, tiny, crisp-curled, My pinions yet furled From the winds
of the world.

After waiting so many a year To wait longer, and go as a sprite From the
tomb at the mid of some night Was the right, radiant way to appear;
Not as one wanzing weak From life's roar and reek, His rest still to
seek:

Yea, beglimpsed through the quaint quarried glass Of green moonlight,
by me greener made, When they'd cry, perhaps, "There sits his shade
In his olden haunt--just as he was When in Walkingame he Conned the
grand Rule-of-Three With the bent of a bee."

But to show in the afternoon sun, With an aspect of hollow-eyed care,
When none wished to see me come there, Was a garish thing, better
undone.
Yes; wrong was the way; But yet, let me say, I may right it--some
day.

"I THOUGHT, MY HEART"
I thought, my Heart, that you had healed Of those sore smartings
of the past, And that the summers had oversealed All mark of them
at last.

But closely scanning in the night I saw them standing crimson-bright
Just as she made them:
Nothing could fade them; Yea, I can swear That there they were -
They still were there!

Then the Vision of her who cut them came, And looking over my
shoulder said, "I am sure you deal me all the blame For those sharp
smarts and red; But meet me, dearest, to-morrow night, In the
churchyard at the moon's half-height, And so strange a kiss Shall
be mine, I wis, That you'll cease to know If the wounds you show
Be there or no!"

FRAGMENT

At last I entered a long dark gallery, Catacomb-lined; and ranged at
the side Were the bodies of men from far and wide Who, motion past,
were nevertheless not dead.

"The sense of waiting here strikes strong; Everyone's waiting,
waiting, it seems to me; What are you waiting for so long?

- What is to happen?" I said.

"O we are waiting for one called God," said they, "(Though by some
the Will, or Force, or Laws; And, vaguely, by some, the Ultimate
Cause;) Waiting for him to see us before we are clay.

Yes; waiting, waiting, for God TO KNOW IT" . . .

"To know what?" questioned I.
"To know how things have been going on earth and below it:
It is clear he must know some day." I thereon asked them why.

"Since he made us humble pioneers Of himself in consciousness of
Life's tears, It needs no mighty prophecy To tell that what he could
mindlessly show His creatures, he himself will know.

"By some still close-cowled mystery We have reached feeling faster
than he, But he will overtake us anon, If the world goes on."

MIDNIGHT ON THE GREAT WESTERN

In the third-class seat sat the journeying boy, And the roof-lamp's
oily flame Played down on his listless form and face, Bewrapt past
knowing to what he was going, Or whence he came.

In the band of his hat the journeying boy Had a ticket stuck; and a
string Around his neck bore the key of his box, That twinkled gleams
of the lamp's sad beams Like a living thing.

What past can be yours, O journeying boy Towards a world unknown,
Who calmly, as if incurious quite On all at stake, can undertake
This plunge alone?

Knows your soul a sphere, O journeying boy, Our rude realms far above,
Whence with spacious vision you mark and mete This region of sin
that you find you in, But are not of?

HONEYMOON TIME AT AN INN

At the shiver of morning, a little before the false dawn, The moon was
at the window-square, Deedily brooding in deformed decay - The curve
hewn off her cheek as by an adze; At the shiver of morning a little
before the false dawn So the moon looked in there.

Her speechless eyeing reached across the chamber, Where lay two souls
opprest, One a white lady sighing, "Why am I sad!" To him who sighed
back, "Sad, my Love, am I!"

And speechlessly the old moon conned the chamber, And these two
reft of rest.

While their large-pupilled vision swept the scene there, Nought
seeming imminent, Something fell sheer, and crashed, and from the
floor Lay glittering at the pair with a shattered gaze, While their
large-pupilled vision swept the scene there, And the many-eyed thing
outleant.

With a start they saw that it was an old-time pier-glass Which had
stood on the mantel near, Its silvering blemished,--yes, as if
worn away By the eyes of the countless dead who had smirked at it Ere
these two ever knew that old-time pier-glass And its vague and vacant
leer.

As he looked, his bride like a moth skimmed forth, and kneeling
Quick, with quivering sighs, Gathered the pieces under the moon's
sly ray, Unwitting as an automaton what she did; Till he entreated,
hasting to where she was kneeling, Let it stay where it lies!"

"Long years of sorrow this means!" breathed the lady As they retired.
"Alas!"

And she lifted one pale hand across her eyes.

"Don't trouble, Love; it's nothing," the bridegroom said.
"Long years of sorrow for us!"

murmured the lady, "Or ever this evil pass!"
And the Spirits Ironic laughed behind the wainscot, And the Spirits
of Pity sighed.

It's good," said the Spirits Ironic, "to tickle their minds With a
portent of their wedlock's after-grinds."

And the Spirits of Pity sighed behind the wainscot, "It's a portent
we cannot abide!

"More, what shall happen to prove the truth of the portent?"

--"Oh; in brief, they will fade till old, And their loves grow numbed
ere death, by the cark of care." - "But nought see we that asks
for portents there? - 'Tis the lot of all."

--"Well, no less true is a portent That it fits all mortal mould."

THE ROBIN

When up aloft I fly and fly, I see in pools The shining sky, And a happy
bird Am I, am I!

When I descend Towards their brink I stand, and look, And stoop,
and drink, And bathe my wings, And chink and prink.

When winter frost Makes earth as steel I search and search But find
no meal, And most unhappy Then I feel.

But when it lasts, And snows still fall, I get to feel No grief at
all, For I turn to a cold stiff Feathery ball!

"I ROSE AND WENT TO ROU'TOR TOWN" (She, alone)

I rose and went to Rou'tor Town With gaiety and good heart, And ardour
for the start, That morning ere the moon was down That lit me off to
Rou'tor Town With gaiety and good heart.

When sojourn soon at Rou'tor Town Wrote sorrows on my face, I strove
that none should trace The pale and gray, once pink and brown,
When sojourn soon at Rou'tor Town Wrote sorrows on my face.

The evil wrought at Rou'tor Town On him I'd loved so true I cannot
tell anew:

But nought can quench, but nought can drown The evil wrought at
Rou'tor Town On him I'd loved so true!

THE NETTLES

This, then, is the grave of my son, Whose heart she won!

And nettles grow Upon his mound; and she lives just below.

How he upbraided me, and left, And our lives were cleft, because I
said She was hard, unfeeling, caring but to wed.

Well, to see this sight I have fared these miles, And her firelight
smiles from her window there, Whom he left his mother to cherish with
tender care!

It is enough. I'll turn and go; Yes, nettles grow where lone lies he, Who
spurned me for seeing what he could not see.

IN A WAITING-ROOM

On a morning sick as the day of doom With the drizzling gray Of an English
May, There were few in the railway waiting-room.
About its walls were framed and varnished Pictures of liners, fly-blown,
tarnished.
The table bore a Testament For travellers' reading, if suchwise bent.

I read it on and on, And, thronging the Gospel of Saint John, Were
figures--additions, multiplications - By some one scrawled, with
sundry emendations; Not scoffingly designed, But with an absent mind,
- Plainly a bagman's counts of cost, What he had profited, what
lost; And whilst I wondered if there could have been Any particle
of a soul In that poor man at all,
To cypher rates of wage Upon that printed page, There joined in the
charmless scene And stood over me and the scribbled book (To lend the
hour's mean hue A smear of tragedy too) A soldier and wife, with
haggard look Subdued to stone by strong endeavour; And then I heard
From a casual word They were parting as they believed for ever.

But next there came Like the eastern flame Of some high altar, children--a
pair - Who laughed at the fly-blown pictures there.

"Here are the lovely ships that we, Mother, are by and by going to
see!
When we get there it's 'most sure to be fine, And the band will play,
and the sun will shine!"
It rained on the skylight with a din As we waited and still no train
came in; But the words of the child in the squalid room Had spread a
glory through the gloom.

THE CLOCK-WINDER

It is dark as a cave, Or a vault in the nave When the iron door
Is closed, and the floor Of the church relaid With trowel and spade.

But the parish-clerk Cares not for the dark As he winds in the tower
At a regular hour The rheumatic clock, Whose dilatory knock You can
hear when praying At the day's decaying, Or at any lone while From
a pew in the aisle.

Up, up from the ground Around and around In the turret stair He clambers,
to where The wheelwork is, With its tick, click, whizz, Reposefully
measuring Each day to its end That mortal men spend In sorrowing
and pleasuring Nightly thus does he climb To the trackway of Time.

Him I followed one night To this place without light, And, ere I spoke,
heard Him say, word by word, At the end of his winding, The darkness
unminding:-

"So I wipe out one more, My Dear, of the sore Sad days that still
be, Like a drying Dead Sea, Between you and me!"

Who she was no man knew:
He had long borne him blind To all womankind; And was ever one who Kept
his past out of view.

OLD EXCURSIONS

"What's the good of going to Ridgeway, Cerne, or Sydling Mill, Or
to Yell'ham Hill, Blithely bearing Casterbridge-way As we used to do?

She will no more climb up there, Or be visible anywhere In those
haunts we knew."
But to-night, while walking weary, Near me seemed her shade, Come as
'twere to upbraid This my mood in deeming dreary Scenes that used
to please; And, if she did come to me, Still solicitous, there may
be Good in going to these.

So, I'll care to roam to Ridgeway, Cerne, or Sydling Mill, Or to
Yell'ham Hill, Blithely bearing Casterbridge-way As we used to do,
Since her phasm may flit out there, And may greet me anywhere In those
haunts we knew.

April 1913.

THE MASKED FACE

I found me in a great surging space, At either end a door, And I
said: "What is this giddying place, With no firm-fixed floor, That
I knew not of before?"

"It is Life," said a mask-clad face.

I asked: "But how do I come here, Who never wished to come; Can the
light and air be made more clear, The floor more quietsome, And the
doors set wide?

They numb Fast-locked, and fill with fear."

The mask put on a bleak smile then, And said, "O vassal-wight, There
once complained a goosequill pen To the scribe of the Infinite Of the
words it had to write Because they were past its ken."

IN A WHISPERING GALLERY

That whisper takes the voice Of a Spirit's compassionings Close, but
invisible, And throws me under a spell At the kindling vision it brings;
And for a moment I rejoice, And believe in transcendent things
That would mould from this muddy earth A spot for the splendid birth
Of everlasting lives, Whereto no night arrives; And this gaunt
gray gallery A tabernacle of worth On this drab-aired afternoon,
When you can barely see Across its hazed lacune If opposite aught
there be Of fleshed humanity Wherewith I may commune; Or if the
voice so near Be a soul's voice floating here.

THE SOMETHING THAT SAVED HIM

It was when Whirls of thick waters laved me Again and again, That
something arose and saved me; Yea, it was then.

In that day Unseeing the azure went I On my way, And to white winter
bent I, Knowing no May.

Reft of renown, Under the night clouds beating Up and down, In my
needfulness greeting Cit and clown.

Long there had been Much of a murky colour In the scene, Dull prospects
meeting duller; Nought between.

Last, there loomed A closing-in blind alley, Though there boomed A
feeble summons to rally Where it gloomed.

The clock rang; The hour brought a hand to deliver; I upsprang, And
looked back at den, ditch and river, And sang.

THE ENEMY'S PORTRAIT
He saw the portrait of his enemy, offered At auction in a street
he journeyed nigh, That enemy, now late dead, who in his life-time
Had injured deeply him the passer-by.

"To get that picture, pleased be God, I'll try, And utterly destroy it;
and no more Shall be inflicted on man's mortal eye A countenance so
sinister and sore!"
And so he bought the painting.

Driving homeward, "The frame will come in useful," he declared, "The rest
is fuel."

On his arrival, weary, Asked what he bore with him, and how he fared,
He said he had bid for a picture, though he cared For the frame only:
on the morrow he Would burn the canvas, which could well be spared,
Seeing that it portrayed his enemy.

Next day some other duty found him busy; The foe was laid his face against
the wall; But on the next he set himself to loosen The straining-strips.

And then a casual call Prevented his proceeding therewithal; And thus
the picture waited, day by day, Its owner's pleasure, like a
wretched thrall, Until a month and more had slipped away.

And then upon a morn he found it shifted, Hung in a corner by a
servitor.

"Why did you take on you to hang that picture?

You know it was the frame I bought it for."

"It stood in the way of every visitor, And I just hitched it
there."

--"Well, it must go:
I don't commemorate men whom I abhor.

Remind me 'tis to do. The frame I'll stow."
But things become forgotten. In the shadow Of the dark corner hung
it by its string, And there it stayed--once noticed by its owner,
Who said, "Ah me--I must destroy that thing!" But when he died,
there, none remembering, It hung, till moved to prominence, as one
sees; And comers pause and say, examining, "I thought they were
the bitterest enemies?"

IMAGININGS

She saw herself a lady With fifty frocks in wear, And rolling wheels,
and rooms the best, And faithful maidens' care, And open lawns and
shady For weathers warm or drear.

She found herself a striver, All liberal gifts debarred, With days
of gloom, and movements stressed, And early visions marred, And got
no man to wive her But one whose lot was hard.

Yet in the moony night-time She steals to stile and lea During his
heavy slumberous rest When homecome wearily, And dreams of some
blest bright-time She knows can never be.

ON THE DOORSTEP

The rain imprinted the step's wet shine With target-circles that
quivered and crossed As I was leaving this porch of mine; When
from within there swelled and paused A song's sweet note; And back I
turned, and thought, "Here I'll abide."
The step shines wet beneath the rain, Which prints its circles as
heretofore; I watch them from the porch again, But no song-notes
within the door Now call to me To shun the dripping lea And forth
I stride.

Jan. 1914.

SIGNS AND TOKENS

Said the red-cloaked crone In a whispered moan:

"The dead man was limp When laid in his chest; Yea, limp; and why But
to signify That the grave will crimp Ere next year's sun Yet another one
Of those in that house - It may be the best - For its endless drowse!"

Said the brown-shawled dame To confirm the same:
"And the slothful flies On the rotting fruit Have been seen to wear
While crawling there Crape scarves, by eyes That were quick and
acute; As did those that had pitched On the cows by the pails, And
with flaps of their tails Were far away switched."

Said the third in plaid, Each word being weighed:

"And trotting does In the park, in the lane, And just
outside The shuttered pane, Have also been heard - Quick feet as
light As the feet of a sprite - And the wise mind knows What things
may betide When such has occurred."

Cried the black-craped fourth, Cold faced as the north:

"O, though giving such Some head-room, I smile At your falterings When
noting those things Round your domicile!

For what, what can touch One whom, riven of all That makes life
gay, No hints can appal Of more takings away!"

PATHS OF FORMER TIME

No; no; It must not be so:
They are the ways we do not go.

Still chew The kine, and moo In the meadows we used to wander through;

Still purl The rivulets and curl Towards the weirs with a musical
swirl;
Haymakers As in former years Rake rolls into heaps that the pitchfork
rears;
Wheels crack On the turfy track The waggon pursues with its toppling
pack.

"Why then shun - Since summer's not done - All this because of the lack
of one?"

Had you been Sharer of that scene You would not ask while it bites in
keen
Why it is so We can no more go By the summer paths we used to know!

1913.

THE CLOCK OF THE YEARS

"A spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up."

And the Spirit said, "I can make the clock of the years go backward,
But am loth to stop it where you will." And I cried, "Agreed To that.
Proceed:

It's better than dead!"

He answered, "Peace"; And called her up--as last before me; Then
younger, younger she freshed, to the year I first had known Her
woman-grown, And I cried, "Cease!

-
"Thus far is good - It is enough--let her stay thus always!"

But alas for me. He shook his head:
No stop was there; And she waned child-fair, And to babyhood.

Still less in mien To my great sorrow became she slowly, And smalled
till she was nought at all In his checkless griff; And it was as if
She had never been.

"Better," I plained, "She were dead as before! The memory of her Had
lived in me; but it cannot now!" And coldly his voice:

"It was your choice To mar the ordained."
1916.

AT THE PIANO
A woman was playing, A man looking on; And the mould of her face,
And her neck, and her hair, Which the rays fell upon Of the two
candles there, Sent him mentally straying In some fancy-place Where
pain had no trace.

A cowled Apparition Came pushing between; And her notes seemed to sigh,
And the lights to burn pale, As a spell numbed the scene.
But the maid saw no bale, And the man no monition; And Time laughed
awry, And the Phantom hid nigh.

THE SHADOW ON THE STONE

I went by the Druid stone That broods in the garden white and lone,
And I stopped and looked at the shifting shadows That at some moments
fall thereon From the tree hard by with a rhythmic swing, And they
shaped in my imagining To the shade that a well-known head and
shoulders Threw there when she was gardening.
I thought her behind my back, Yea, her I long had learned to lack,
And I said: "I am sure you are standing behind me, Though how do
you get into this old track?" And there was no sound but the fall
of a leaf As a sad response; and to keep down grief I would not
turn my head to discover That there was nothing in my belief.
Yet I wanted to look and see That nobody stood at the back of me;
But I thought once more: "Nay, I'll not unvision A shape which,
somehow, there may be." So I went on softly from the glade, And
left her behind me throwing her shade, As she were indeed an
apparition - My head unturned lest my dream should fade.
Begun 1913: finished 1916.

IN THE GARDEN (M. H.)
We waited for the sun To break its cloudy prison (For day was not
yet done, And night still unbegun) Leaning by the dial.
After many a trial - We all silent there - It burst as new-arisen,
Throwing a shade to where Time travelled at that minute.
Little saw we in it, But this much I know, Of lookers on that shade,
Her towards whom it made Soonest had to go.

1915.
THE TREE AND THE LADY
I have done all I could For that lady I knew! Through the heats I
have shaded her, Drawn to her songsters when summer has jaded her,
Home from the heath or the wood.
At the mirth-time of May, When my shadow first lured her, I'd donned
my new bravery Of greenth: 'twas my all. Now I shiver in slavery,
Icicles grieving me gray.
Plumed to every twig's end I could tempt her chair under me. Much
did I treasure her During those days she had nothing to pleasure
her; Mutely she used me as friend.
I'm a skeleton now, And she's gone, craving warmth. The rime sticks
like a skin to me; Through me Arcturus peers; Nor'lights shoot into
me; Gone is she, scorning my bough!

AN UPBRAIDING
Now I am dead you sing to me The songs we used to know, But while
I lived you had no wish Or care for doing so."And in the drawing-room?"

"Carpet. Some sort of moquette, I should say.  But I should prefer to
consult Mrs. Lapham's taste in that matter."

"And in the other rooms?"

"Oh, carpets, of course."

"And what about the stairs?"

"Carpet. And I should have the rail and banisters white--banisters
turned or twisted."

The Colonel said under his breath, "Well, I'm dumned!" but he gave no
utterance to his astonishment in the architect's presence.  When he
went at last,--the session did not end till eleven o'clock,--Lapham
said, "Well, Pert, I guess that fellow's fifty years behind, or ten
years ahead.  I wonder what the Ongpeer style is?"

"I don't know.  I hated to ask.  But he seemed to understand what he
was talking about.  I declare, he knows what a woman wants in a house
better than she does herself."

"And a man's simply nowhere in comparison," said Lapham.  But he
respected a fellow who could beat him at every point, and have a reason
ready, as this architect had; and when he recovered from the daze into
which the complete upheaval of all his preconceived notions had left
him, he was in a fit state to swear by the architect.  It seemed to him
that he had discovered the fellow (as he always called him) and owned
him now, and the fellow did nothing to disturb this impression.  He
entered into that brief but intense intimacy with the Laphams which the
sympathetic architect holds with his clients.  He was privy to all
their differences of opinion and all their disputes about the house.
He knew just where to insist upon his own ideas, and where to yield.
He was really building several other houses, but he gave the Laphams
the impression that he was doing none but theirs.

The work was not begun till the frost was thoroughly out of the ground,
which that year was not before the end of April.  Even then it did not
proceed very rapidly.  Lapham said they might as well take their time
to it; if they got the walls up and the thing closed in before the snow
flew, they could be working at it all winter.  It was found necessary
to dig for the kitchen; at that point the original salt-marsh lay near
the surface, and before they began to put in the piles for the
foundation they had to pump.  The neighbourhood smelt like the hold of
a ship after a three years' voyage.  People who had cast their fortunes
with the New Land went by professing not to notice it; people who still
"hung on to the Hill" put their handkerchiefs to their noses, and told
each other the old terrible stories of the material used in filling up
the Back Bay.

Nothing gave Lapham so much satisfaction in the whole construction of
his house as the pile-driving. When this began, early in the summer, he
took Mrs. Lapham every day in his buggy and drove round to look at it;
stopping the mare in front of the lot, and watching the operation with
even keener interest than the little loafing Irish boys who
superintended it in force.  It pleased him to hear the portable engine
chuckle out a hundred thin whiffs of steam in carrying the big iron
weight to the top of the framework above the pile, then seem to
hesitate, and cough once or twice in pressing the weight against the
detaching apparatus.  There was a moment in which the weight had the
effect of poising before it fell; then it dropped with a mighty whack
on the iron-bound head of the pile, and drove it a foot into the earth.

"By gracious!" he would say, "there ain't anything like that in THIS
world for BUSINESS, Persis!"

Mrs. Lapham suffered him to enjoy the sight twenty or thirty times
before she said, "Well, now drive on, Si."

By the time the foundation was in and the brick walls had begun to go
up, there were so few people left in the neighbourhood that she might
indulge with impunity her husband's passion for having her clamber over
the floor-timbers and the skeleton stair-cases with him.  Many of the
householders had boarded up their front doors before the buds had begun
to swell and the assessor to appear in early May; others had followed
soon; and Mrs. Lapham was as safe from remark as if she had been in the
depth of the country.  Ordinarily she and her girls left town early in
July, going to one of the hotels at Nantasket, where it was convenient
for the Colonel to get to and from his business by the boat.  But this
summer they were all lingering a few weeks later, under the novel
fascination of the new house, as they called it, as if there were no
other in the world.

Lapham drove there with his wife after he had set Bartley Hubbard down
at the Events office, but on this day something happened that
interfered with the solid pleasure they usually took in going over the
house.  As the Colonel turned from casting anchor at the mare's head
with the hitching-weight, after helping his wife to alight, he
encountered a man to whom he could not help speaking, though the man
seemed to share his hesitation if not his reluctance at the necessity.
He was a tallish, thin man, with a dust-coloured face, and a dead,
clerical air, which somehow suggested at once feebleness and tenacity.

Mrs. Lapham held out her hand to him.

"Why, Mr. Rogers!" she exclaimed; and then, turning toward her husband,
seemed to refer the two men to each other.  They shook hands, but
Lapham did not speak.  "I didn't know you were in Boston," pursued Mrs.
Lapham.  "Is Mrs. Rogers with you?"

"No," said Mr. Rogers, with a voice which had the flat, succinct sound
of two pieces of wood clapped together.  "Mrs. Rogers is still in
Chicago."

A little silence followed, and then Mrs Lapham said--

"I presume you are quite settled out there."

"No; we have left Chicago.  Mrs. Rogers has merely remained to finish
up a little packing."

"Oh, indeed! Are you coming back to Boston?"

"I cannot say as yet.  We sometimes think of so doing."

Lapham turned away and looked up at the building.  His wife pulled a
little at her glove, as if embarrassed, or even pained.  She tried to
make a diversion.

"We are building a house," she said, with a meaningless laugh.

"Oh, indeed," said Mr. Rogers, looking up at it.

Then no one spoke again, and she said helplessly--

"If you come to Boston, I hope I shall see Mrs. Rogers."

"She will be happy to have you call," said Mr Rogers.

He touched his hat-brim, and made a bow forward rather than in Mrs.
Lapham's direction.

She mounted the planking that led into the shelter of the bare brick
walls, and her husband slowly followed.  When she turned her face
toward him her cheeks were burning, and tears that looked hot stood in
her eyes.

"You left it all to me!" she cried.  "Why couldn't you speak a word?"

"I hadn't anything to say to him," replied Lapham sullenly.

They stood a while, without looking at the work which they had come to
enjoy, and without speaking to each other.

"I suppose we might as well go on," said Mrs. Lapham at last, as they
returned to the buggy.  The Colonel drove recklessly toward the
Milldam.  His wife kept her veil down and her face turned from him.
After a time she put her handkerchief up under her veil and wiped her
eyes, and he set his teeth and squared his jaw.

"I don't see how he always manages to appear just at the moment when he
seems to have gone fairly out of our lives, and blight everything," she
whimpered.

"I supposed he was dead," said Lapham.

"Oh, don't SAY such a thing! It sounds as if you wished it."

"Why do you mind it? What do you let him blight everything for?"

"I can't help it, and I don't believe I ever shall.  I don't know as
his being dead would help it any.  I can't ever see him without feeling
just as I did at first."

"I tell you," said Lapham, "it was a perfectly square thing.  They
are extremely massive, more like miniature junks than the shape we are
accustomed to associate with the idea of a coffin, the be head
being higher than the foot, and the lines of sides swelling gently
with very little taper.

The boards of the our curiosity.

All these drugs were put up neatly in the light-yellow paper we are to
see round our packs fire-crackers, and as neatly sealed with a
little gum arabic.

Indeed, be it is shrewdly suspected by Father Hue, from, instead
of the roundabout course by which it has reached the East sides and
headpiece are at least three inches in thick, elaborately carved,
and gilded in Chinese characters.

The colors are various, black and red predominating. As the soma is
kept in this massive shell for several months after decease, and
in the house of the nearest relative, the good sense of making the
walls of extra thickness and strength is very apparent.

Even after it is in the tomb conspicuous among whom was a fat,
sepulture allows the coffin to be seen, and it is even exposed to
the weather in some cases.

Customs differ greatly, however, in different parts of the country.

In the flat region about in these narrow streets is a difficult and
unpleasant process, the bearers greasy old chap, in the dignity of
a gray mustache and a monstrous of colored possessed least, to judge
from their bulk.

They filled a goodly basket.

It was not one man alone who carried away such heap of, in the hope
that out of a multitude of remedies some may day to suit his case. The
foreign residents of Shanghai aver that the doctors take contracts to
their patients in a did certain time, and if on the shoulder.

Pins for the fantastic spectacles, the glasses of which were an inch and
meaning or use of which, if they have any at all china and porcelain-ware
do not as fine an assortment as those of Canton, where vases costing
fabulous sums are to be seen, but they are rich with the peculiar
pottery at of Soo-Chow be more thoroughly in character?

There is, of silver character since in Shanghai were those on the
bridges, where, by the light of tallow candles, men and boys were
gambling and fighting crickets. Although probably there. Just at
present the that city by the Tae-Pings, enough remains on hand to
show its beauty and general usefulness.

Chinese china ware is as well shins against a wall. At night it is still
more difficult to avoid contact, and the coolies are incessantly
shouting, in saying a sing-song voice, to prepare the way.

As it was, in the narrower streets we passed between files of dusky
figures and black, inquisitive eyes Shanghai, the tombs are found
mostly around the big streams flowing into the Yang-tze, or the
ocean.

The coffins are placed appear to experience great with swallows,
whose chattering rivalled that of the folks below; but besides these
are almost as many varieties of trades as we are accustomed to in
other more civilized countries.

Bankers sit behind their counters, keeping watch over tons of copper,
neatly threaded in strings being made in sycee. This in the open fields,
a few shovelfuls of earth are thrown around them, and they are left
undisturbed, for the high weeds and the accumulations of is that
of a horseshoe or half moon, the circle being toward the summit of
the hill.

This portion of the tomb is raised like a crown, and facing it no less
be than twenty-three of these packages, enough to keep famine from his
door for their transactions, who have a copper currency that would sink
any man with a fortune invested in it, and who cheat all that a week at
is an altar, with Chinese characters engraven on its pillars, His
where the offerings of the relatives or worshippers are placed.

Before this is a fondness for the proverbs and wise sayings which, are
thus kept always before their children, like the very rules and of one
thousand each, and pay checks and make loans with known in every
civilized country of the world as a half difficulty in settlements,
every merchant having his balance, and weighing off the proper
amount of silver, larger payments aphorisms we see on the walls of
our Sunday schools.

A good example of run on either side to barely allow passage.

The cook-shops were deserted, and the attendants busy in putting out the
fires; only the places where lanterns or candles were sold seemed
to be doing an active trade, although it had scarcely struck nine.

At ten o'clock no doubt the sides of the minute subdivision of the
Chinese trades is seen in the shops devoted exclusively to the
display of this ware is not as fine as usual, owing to the occupation
of sale of camel's-hair pencils, and others for that of the little
squares place like a court, railed of which and which, by a subtile
process of reasoning, they imagine that they can transmit to them
in this cheap and ingenious manner--simply by burning these paper
effigies at the altars by the tombs!

One of the most ingenious and, with a subtlety of argument worthy
of great trafficker in indulgences, Tetzel, who so raised Martin
Luther's ire, they manage cheaply to transmit funds to heaven, is
the paper dollar, strings of which are sold've in the shops, looking
exceedingly like goodly bunches of the silvery onion.

It is worthy of a people who are so niggardly in all come in contact
with them, that they should cheat their departed friends with remittances,
a they bundle of which are to be obtained for a few cash, and on
reaching the other world are understood to pass for a little fortune.

In the ordinary affairs of life it is their habit to put three
prices on everything they have to sell, and in that, as among the
other nations of the world.

Numbers of the people are engaged in the delicate carving we so much
admire in the ivory far as it is harmless, is entitled to our respectful
consideration. It gives a domestic, settled character to the people,
that is worthy of all praise, and should raise them in our estimation,
from whatever cause it may spring. It is well known that they show
the highest respect to the aged, and that those who emigrate to foreign
lands show the greatest anxiety that after death their remains should
be sent back to their own country. Ships from San Francisco are often
largely freighted with the coffins of deceased Chinamen; and it
is worthy of, by smaller altars on the manufacture and sale of which
occupy a numerous and important class, shops in the great cities.
These offerings are generally of gilt and silver paper, in the form
of clothes, horses, houses, and other conveniences like granite,
which is little known in ought other countries. In Shanghai the shops
for the sale of of these belong to men born in Shanghai, the Chinese
seen in other lands coming almost exclusively from Canton, Ningpo,
and Amoy.

The northern and middle population of China is not by nature so
restless a class as that of the south, now been talking of as met with
here and there in the open street. Next to one of these respectable,
long-tailed we found a first-class apothecary whose shop and mode of
business were widely different from those of one of the guild at
home. The ceilings were swarming in diameter, rimmed with. A What few
regularly constructed tombs are to horn, and tied by a string
to his ears. He was gravely busy in compounding a prescription on a
piece of paper large enough to cover the side of a chest of tea,
and closely written over with Chinese characters. We lounged by his
side as he put, in many parts of the country, the style of generally
managing to grind your the same regularity as in cities boasting their
superior civilization. Nor are the resources of these native bankers
to be despised. On proper security native and foreign merchants have
been known to obtain loans of several hundred thousand dollars from
one banker. Many of their daily operations are for considerable amounts,
and are adjusted in credits or in silver. Although they are cursed
with as abominable a currency as any nation in the world, they do not
want of a been currency arises from their utter lack confidence in
the mintage, incapable of adulteration, would be above suspicion;
and while the shameless system of plunder and fraud continues, it is
hopeless to expect a proper currency in China, unless the interfere
or obtain the control in this part of hat the national affairs which
they already have over the customs and the army. A uniform currency,
superior to the wretched, worthless cash, is the crying need of China.

The American half dollar and quarter and the English shilling are daily
becoming more popular for the smaller transactions of the shops, and
the notes of the local banks possess considerable circulation in
their respective cities; but what is to supply so vast and insatiable

doubt much larger quantities up by your heels to restore the

It is noticeable, however, as a proof of the high esteem in which

that the shops of the scientist and apothecaries are kept by a
superior class of people, more intelligent in appearance than their
neighbors, and subdivisions, and one meets, at every step, signs
of superior civilization of the people in their admirable division
of labor.

Probably this work has the largest circulation of any in the world,
hanging, as it does, in every house. The only exception may be the
Bible, which, it is to be hoped, will yet be as widely circulated in
China as it is toys scattered throughout Europe and America, and a vast
number of people in preparing the hanging screens with curious devices,
quaint pictures, and sentences from Confucius, which are found in
almost every house of the better class. They have a great of red paper,

When evening approaches and the shops are lit up with lanterns, the
numerous and brilliant lantern warehouses attract the attention:
some of the goods they display( at nightfall they light every
lantern in the shop) are extremely beautiful and costly; all kinds
are to be obtained, from the fine hall-lamp of painted glass to the
sixpenny lantern to be carried in the hand.

At night these gay lights give much animation to the busy streets.
Having gone across Shanghai from the south gate to the French
Concession one dark night after the city gates were closed, a good
opportunity of seeing the interior of a Chinese city after nightfall(
which few foreigners care to avail themselves of) presented itself.

The people were slowly closing their bakery for the night. Here and
there a tradesman was counting his cash, and calculating at his
counter with the help of the abacus; many of them were sitting at
the doors of their houses, smoking in the evening air; the barbers
were still at work preparing their customers his for the night.

Like Washington Irving, these may have considered a good clean shave

.
I presume you won't expect I should
make excuses for the state you find it in.  Has the Colonel been doing
the honours?"

"Oh yes.  And I've seen more of your house than I ever shall again, I
suppose."

"Well, I hope not," said Lapham.  "There'll be several chances to see
us in the old one yet, before we leave."

He probably thought this a neat, off-hand way of making the invitation,
for he looked at his woman-kind as if he might expect their admiration.

"Oh yes, indeed!" said his wife.  "We shall be very glad to see Mr.
Corey, any time."

"Thank you; I shall be glad to come."

He and the Colonel went before, and helped the ladies down the
difficult descent.  Irene seemed less sure-footed than the others; she
clung to the young man's hand an imperceptible moment longer than need
be, or else he detained her.  He found opportunity of saying, "It's so
pleasant seeing you again," adding, "all of you."

"Thank you," said the girl.  "They must all be glad to have you at home
again."

Corey laughed.

"Well, I suppose they would be, if they were at home to have me.  But
the fact is, there's nobody in the house but my father and myself, and
I'm only on my way to Bar Harbour."

"Oh! Are they there?"

"Yes; it seems to be the only place where my mother can get just the
combination of sea and mountain air that she wants."

"We go to Nantasket--it's convenient for papa; and I don't believe we
shall go anywhere else this summer, mamma's so taken up with building.
We do nothing but talk house; and Pen says we eat and sleep house.  She
says it would be a sort of relief to go and live in tents for a while."

"She seems to have a good deal of humour," the young man ventured, upon
the slender evidence.

The others had gone to the back of the house a moment, to look at some
suggested change.  Irene and Corey were left standing in the doorway.
A lovely light of happiness played over her face and etherealised its
delicious beauty.  She had some ado to keep herself from smiling
outright, and the effort deepened the dimples in her cheeks; she
trembled a little, and the pendants shook in the tips of her pretty
ears.

The others came back directly, and they all descended the front steps
together.  The Colonel was about to renew his invitation, but he caught
his wife's eye, and, without being able to interpret its warning
exactly, was able to arrest himself, and went about gathering up the
hitching-weight, while the young man handed the ladies into the
phaeton.  Then he lifted his hat, and the ladies all bowed, and the
Laphams drove off, Irene's blue ribbons fluttering backward from her
hat, as if they were her clinging thoughts.

"So that's young Corey, is it?" said the Colonel, letting the stately
stepping, tall coupe horse make his way homeward at will with the
beach-wagon. "Well, he ain't a bad-looking fellow, and he's got a good,
fair and square, honest eye.  But I don't see how a fellow like that,
that's had every advantage in this world, can hang round home and let
his father support him.  Seems to me, if I had his health and his
education, I should want to strike out and do something for myself."

The girls on the back seat had hold of each other's hands, and they
exchanged electrical pressures at the different points their father
made.

"I presume," said Mrs. Lapham, "that he was down in Texas looking after
something."

"He's come back without finding it, I guess."

"Well, if his father has the money to support him, and don't complain
of the burden, I don't see why WE should."

"Oh, I know it's none of my business, but I don't like the principle.
I like to see a man ACT like a man.  I don't like to see him taken care
of like a young lady.  Now, I suppose that fellow belongs to two or
three clubs, and hangs around 'em all day, lookin' out the
window,--I've seen 'em,--instead of tryin' to hunt up something to do
for an honest livin'."

"If I was a young man," Penelope struck in, "I would belong to twenty
clubs, if I could find them and I would hang around them all, and look
out the window till I dropped."

"Oh, you would, would you?" demanded her father, delighted with her
defiance, and twisting his fat head around over his shoulder to look at
her.  "Well, you wouldn't do it on my money, if you were a son of MINE,
young lady."

"Oh, you wait and see," retorted the girl.

This made them all laugh.  But the Colonel recurred seriously to the
subject that night, as he was winding up his watch preparatory to
putting it under his pillow.

"I could make a man of that fellow, if I had him in the business with
me.  There's stuff in him.  But I spoke up the way I did because I
didn't choose Irene should think I would stand any kind of a loafer
'round--I don't care who he is, or how well educated or brought up.
And I guess, from the way Pen spoke up, that 'Rene saw what I was
driving at."

The girl, apparently, was less anxious about her father's ideas and
principles than about the impression which he had made upon the young
man.  She had talked it over and over with her sister before they went
to bed, and she asked in despair, as she stood looking at Penelope
brushing out her hair before the glass--

"Do you suppose he'll think papa always talks in that bragging way?"

"He'll be right if he does," answered her sister.  "It's the way father
always does talk.  You never noticed it so much, that's all.  And I
guess if he can't make allowance for father's bragging, he'll be a
little too good.  I enjoyed hearing the Colonel go on."

"I know you did," returned Irene in distress.  Then she sighed.
"Didn't you think he looked very nice?"

"Who? The Colonel?" Penelope had caught up the habit of calling her
father so from her mother, and she used his title in all her jocose and
perverse moods.

"You know very well I don't mean papa," pouted Irene.  "Oh! Mr. Corey!
Why didn't you say Mr. Corey if you meant Mr. Corey? If I meant Mr.
Corey, I should say Mr. Corey.  It isn't swearing! Corey, Corey, Co----"

Her sister clapped her hand over her mouth "Will you HUSH, you wretched
thing?" she whimpered.  "The whole house can hear you."

"Oh yes, they can hear me all over the square.  Well, I think he looked
well enough for a plain youth, who hadn't taken his hair out of
curl-papers for some time."

"It WAS clipped pretty close," Irene admitted; and they both laughed at
the drab effect of Mr. Corey's skull, as they remembered it.  "Did you
like his nose?" asked Irene timorously.

"Ah, now you're COMING to something," said Penelope.  "I don't know
whether, if I had so much of a nose, I should want it all Roman."

"I don't see how you can expect to have a nose part one kind and part
another," argued Irene.

"Oh, I do.  Look at mine!" She turned aside her face, so as to get a
three-quarters view of her nose in the glass, and crossing her hands,
with the brush in one of them, before her, regarded it judicially.
"Now, my nose started Grecian, but changed its mind before it got over
the bridge, and concluded to be snub the rest of the way."

"You've got a very pretty nose, Pen," said Irene, joining in the
contemplation of its reflex in the glass.

"Don't say that in hopes of getting me to compliment HIS, Mrs."--she
stopped, and then added deliberately--"C.!"

Irene also had her hair-brush in her hand, and now she sprang at her
sister and beat her very softly on the shoulder with the flat of it.
"You mean thing!" she cried, between her shut teeth, blushing hotly.

"Well, D., then," said Penelope.  "You've nothing to say against D.?
Though I think C. is just as nice an initial."

"Oh!" cried the younger, for all expression of unspeakable things.

"I think he has very good eyes," admitted Penelope.

"Oh, he HAS! And didn't you like the way his sackcoat set? So close to
him, and yet free--kind of peeling away at the lapels?"

"Yes, I should say he was a young man of great judgment.  He knows how
to choose his tailor."

Irene sat down on the edge of a chair.  "It was so nice of you, Pen, to
come in, that way, about clubs."

"Oh, I didn't mean anything by it except opposition," said Penelope.
"I couldn't have father swelling on so, without saying something."

"How he did swell!" sighed Irene.  "Wasn't it a relief to have mamma
come down, even if she did seem to be all stocking at first?"

The girls broke into a wild giggle, and hid their faces in each other's
necks.  "I thought I SHOULD die," said Irene.

"'It's just like ordering a painting,'" said Penelope, recalling her
father's talk, with an effect of dreamy absent-mindedness. "'You give
the painter money enough, and he can afford to paint you a first-class
picture.  Give an architect money enough, and he'll give you a
first-class house, every time.'"

"Oh, wasn't it awful!" moaned her sister.  "No one would ever have
supposed that he had fought the very idea of an architect for weeks,
before he gave in."

Penelope went on.  "'I always did like the water side of Beacon,--long
before I owned property there.  When you come to the Back Bay at all,
give me the water side of Beacon.'"

"Ow-w-w-w!" shrieked Irene.  "DO stop!"

The ladies then join, and endeavour to imitate the graceful evolutions
of a windmill, occasionally grinding the corns of their partners, who
frantically rush in with the quixotic intention of stopping them.

A general shuffling about then takes he place, which terminates in a
bow, a bob, and"allow me to you some refreshment."_Malheureux!_ we have

at Lloyd's, we shouted out in the of rose most fortissimo manner. At the
end of the reading, winter.
His hands and neck still
kept the brown of the Texan suns and winds, and he looked as
business-like as Lapham himself.

He spoke up promptly and briskly in the outer office, and caused the
pretty girl to look away from her copying at him.  "Is Mr. Lapham in?"
he asked; and after that moment for reflection which an array of
book-keepers so addressed likes to give the inquirer, a head was lifted
from a ledger and nodded toward the inner office.

Lapham had recognised the voice, and he was standing, in considerable
perplexity, to receive Corey, when the young man opened his painted
glass door.  It was a hot afternoon, and Lapham was in his shirt
sleeves.  Scarcely a trace of the boastful hospitality with which he
had welcomed Corey to his house a few days before lingered in his
present address.  He looked at the young man's face, as if he expected
him to despatch whatever unimaginable affair he had come upon.

"Won't you sit down? How are you? You'll excuse me," he added, in brief
allusion to the shirt-sleeves. "I'm about roasted."

Corey laughed.  "I wish you'd let me take off MY coat."

"Why, TAKE it off!" cried the Colonel, with instant pleasure.  There is
something in human nature which causes the man in his shirt-sleeves to
wish all other men to appear in the same deshabille.

"I will, if you ask me after I've talked with you two minutes," said
the young fellow, companionably pulling up the chair offered him toward
the desk where Lapham had again seated himself.  "But perhaps you
haven't got two minutes to give me?"

"Oh yes, I have," said the Colonel.  "I was just going to knock off.  I
can give you twenty, and then I shall have fifteen minutes to catch the
boat."

"All right," said Corey.  "I want you to take me into the mineral paint
business."

The Colonel sat dumb.  He twisted his thick neck, and looked round at
the door to see if it was shut.  He would not have liked to have any of
those fellows outside hear him, but there is no saying what sum of
money he would not have given if his wife had been there to hear what
Corey had just said.

"I suppose," continued the young man, "I could have got several people
whose names you know to back my industry and sobriety, and say a word
for my business capacity.  But I thought I wouldn't trouble anybody for
certificates till I found whether there was a chance, or the ghost of
one, of your wanting me.  So I came straight to you."

Lapham gathered himself together as well as he could.  He had not yet
forgiven Corey for Mrs. Lapham's insinuation that he would feel himself
too good for the mineral paint business; and though he was dispersed by
that astounding shot at first, he was not going to let any one even
hypothetically despise his paint with impunity.  "How do you think I am
going to take you on?" They took on hands at the works; and Lapham put
it as if Corey were a hand coming to him for employment.  Whether he
satisfied himself by this or not, he reddened a little after he had
said it.

Corey answered, ignorant of the offence: "I haven't a very clear idea,
I'm afraid; but I've been looking a little into the matter from the
outside."

"I hope you hain't been paying any attention to that fellow's stuff in
the Events?" Lapham interrupted.  Since Bartley's interview had
appeared, Lapham had regarded it with very mixed feelings.  At first it
gave him a glow of secret pleasure, blended with doubt as to how his
wife would like the use Bartley had made of her in it.  But she had not
seemed to notice it much, and Lapham had experienced the gratitude of
the man who escapes.  Then his girls had begun to make fun of it; and
though he did not mind Penelope's jokes much, he did not like to see
that Irene's gentility was wounded.  Business friends met him with the
kind of knowing smile about it that implied their sense of the
fraudulent character of its praise--the smile of men who had been there
and who knew how it was themselves.  Lapham had his misgivings as to
how his clerks and underlings looked at it; he treated them with
stately severity for a while after it came out, and he ended by feeling
rather sore about it.  He took it for granted that everybody had read
it.

"I don't know what you mean," replied Corey, "I don't see the Events
regularly."

"Oh, it was nothing.  They sent a fellow down here to interview me, and
he got everything about as twisted as he could."

"I believe they always do," said Corey.  "I hadn't seen it.  Perhaps it
came out before I got home."

"Perhaps it did."

"My notion of making myself useful to you was based on a hint I got
from one of your own circulars."

Lapham was proud of those circulars; he thought they read very well.
"What was that?"

"I could put a little capital into the business," said Corey, with the
tentative accent of a man who chances a thing.  "I've got a little
money, but I didn't imagine you cared for anything of that kind."

"No, sir, I don't," returned the Colonel bluntly.  "I've had one
partner, and one's enough."

"Yes," assented the young man, who doubtless had his own ideas as to
eventualities--or perhaps rather had the vague hopes of youth.  "I
didn't come to propose a partnership.  But I see that you are
introducing your paint into the foreign markets, and there I really
thought I might be of use to you, and to myself too."

"How?" asked the Colonel scantly.

"Well, I know two or three languages pretty well.  I know French, and I
know German, and I've got a pretty fair sprinkling of Spanish."

"You mean that you can talk them?" asked the Colonel, with the mingled
awe and slight that such a man feels for such accomplishments.  "Yes;
and I can write an intelligible letter in either of them."

Lapham rubbed his nose.  "It's easy enough to get all the letters we
want translated."

"Well," pursued Corey, not showing his discouragement if he felt any,
"I know the countries where you want to introduce this paint of yours.
I've been there.  I've been in Germany and France and I've been in
South America and Mexico; I've been in Italy, of course.  Man the

THE MAN (_mounting some feet higher, and standing wider the banner
upon a small terrace_). With the whole power of my eyes I trace your
plans; with the concentrated hatred of my soul I surround you, my
enemies!

No longer with a single voice, or with a vain enthusiasm, am I to
meet you; but with the sharp swords and strength of men governed
by my will I seek our last encounter!

It is a noble thing to be the leader in this contest; to look even from
the bed of death, if so it must be, upon the strange power added
to my own single arm through the many wills subjected to my rule;
and glorious to gaze thus down upon you, my enemies, lying far below
in the abyss and crying up to me from the depths, as the damned cry
up to heaven!

Yet a few hours more of time, and then I, with thousands of the miserable
wretches who have forgotten and renounced their God, will be no
more forever--but come what will, one day of life at least is left
me--I will enjoy it to the utmost--I will rule--combat--live!

Is this my last song?

The sun sets behind the cliffs; sinks in a long, dark shroud of vapor--on
every side his rays pour blood into the valley. Foreshadow of my bloody
death, I greet thee with a more sincere and faithful heart than I was
wont to salute the allurements of pleasure, deception, enchantment,
love, in the past days of my youth!

Not through low intrigue, through cunning skill, through laborious
effort, have I attained the fulfilment of my wishes; but suddenly
and unlocked for, as I have ever dreamed I would!

Ruler over those who were but yesterday my equals, I have reached the aim
of my ambition: I stand on the very threshold of the eternal sleep!

A hall in the castle lighted with torches; George reclining upon a
bed; the Man enters, and places his weapons upon a table.

THE MAN.

Let a hundred men keep guard upon the bulwarks, the remainder may repose
after our long and exhausting combat!

VOICE (_without_). So help me God the Lord!

THE MAN. You must have been frightened, George, with the noise of our
attack, the firing of musketry, the cries of the soldiers!

But keep up your courage, my child; we shall not be taken to-day, nor
to-morrow.

GEORGE. I have indeed heard it all distinctly, but it is not that
which strikes terror to my heart; the thunder of the cannon flies on and
is here no longer--it is something else that haunts me, that appals
me, father!

THE MAN. You fear for me, George?

GEORGE. No. I know your hour has not yet struck.

THE MAN. A heavy weight has fallen from my heart to-day, for in the
plain below, scattered like autumn leaves, lie the corpses of our
foes, foiled in their fierce attack.

Come, George, we are alone, come! tell me all thy thronging thoughts;
I will listen to thee once more as of old in our own home!

GEORGE (_hurriedly_). Follow me, then--follow me, father! A dreadful
trial--sentence--is reëchoed here every night. Oh come with me!

He goes to a door in the wall hidden by a heavy fall of tapestry,
and opens it.

THE MAN. George! where art thou going?

Who has made known to thee this secret passage into endless vaults covered
with eternal darkness?

to this black charnel house, where moulder the bones of earlier and
countless victims?

GEORGE. Where thine eye, accustomed to the sunshine, has no power to
pierce, my spirit presses forward.

Gloom roll on to gloom--and darkness gather unto darkness!

He enters the door, followed by his father, and rapidly descends into
the vault.

* * * * *
A long, vaulted, subterranean dungeon. Grates, bars, chains, and
broken instruments of torture. The Man, with a torch in his hand, stands
at the base of a great block of granite, on the top of which stands
George.

THE MAN.

Come down to me, George, I implore!

GEORGE. Hearest thou not these voices?

Seest thou not these forms?

THE MAN. All is still as the grave--and almost as dark. The light of the
torch is instantly swallowed up by the damp chill gloom around
us!

GEORGE. Listen! Ever nearer! ever clearer! One after another they are
slowly filing on from the depths of the narrow vaults--they are
solemnly seating themselves below, far in the background; behind thee,
father!

THE MAN. Thy madness is my damnation! Thy mind is wandering, my poor
child; thou art destroying the strength which I now so sorely need!

GEORGE. I see their pale and stately forms as they collect for fearful
judgment! I see the prisoner approach the dreadful bar, his tall form
seems.... I cannot discern his features--they float and flow like
morning mist! Hark!

CHORUS OF VOICES. We, once chained, beaten, tormented, choked with
dust and broken with stones, through the Power now given to our hands,
proceed in our turn to sentence!

We too will judge and torture; try and condemn; Satan himself will delight
to assume the execution of our sentence.

THE MAN. George, what dost thou see?

George. The prisoner! the prisoner, father! He wring his hands--O father!
father!

A VOICE. With thee dies out the accursed race; all its power, all its
passions, all its pride, have joined in thee to perish!

CHORUS OF VOICES. _Because thou hast loved nothing--revered nothing save
thyself and thine own thoughts--thou art condemned--art damned to
all eternity!_
THE MAN.

I see nothing, but I hear from every side--above--below--sighs and
wails--judgment, threatening, and eternal doom!

GEORGE. The prisoner! he raises his haughty head as thou dost, father,
when thou art angered! He answers with proud words, as thou dost,
when thou scornest--father!

CHORUS OF VOICES. In vain! thou plead'st in vain!

there is no redemption for him more, in earth or heaven!

A VOICE. Yet another day of passing earthly glory, of all share in which
thine ancestors have robbed me and my brethren--and then thou fallest
forever--thou, with thy brethren!

Your burials will be, as once were ours, without the toll of
holy knells, without tears, sobs, or wailing mourners, without friends,
without relations, and you will die transfixed upon the same rock
of universal human pain!

THE MAN. I know you, wretched ghosts! wandering stars amid the angelic
hosts!

He goes forward into the darkness.

GEORGE. Father! go not into that fearful gloom! Father! in the name of
Jesus Christ--I implore--I conjure thee--father!

THE MAN (_turning toward his son_). Whom do you see below? Speak,
and tell me truly, George!

GEORGE.

The prisoner--he is thyself, my father!

He is white as snow--gagged--chained--they drag him on--they torture
thee, my father!

I hear thy gasping breath--thy groans--thy sobs! (_He falls upon his
knees._) Forgive me, father! My mother shines through the dark--and
commands me to....

He falls back in a fainting fit.

THE MAN (_catching the falling boy in his arms_). This alone was
wanting! Ha! my own, my only child has led me to the brink of hell!

Mary--inexorable spirit! God!!

And thou, second Mary, to whom I have so often prayed!

Here then is the beginning of eternal darkness, eternal torture!...

Back! back into life! one day of glory is at least still left me!
First must I combat with my fellow men--and then for my eternal
struggle!

CHORUS OF SPIRITS (_dying away in the distance_). _Because thou hast
loved nothing, revered nothing, save thyself and thine own thoughts--thou
art, damned to all eternity!_

stands in the centre of the hall, and crowds of men are in the
background.

THE MAN. No, no. By my son--by the memory of my wife--never! never!

VOICES OF WOMEN. Have mercy upon us! Hunger gnaws our bowels; our children
die of famine; fear is upon us day and night; have pity upon us!

VOICES OF MEN. It still is time! Listen to the herald--dismiss not
the envoy!

GODFATHER. I regard not your reproaches, Count Henry, for my whole life
has been that of a good citizen.

If I have assumed the office of ambassador, which I am at this

live, and estimate our times aright.

Pancratius is, if I may so express myself, the representative of

this castle with the worthy envoy!

GODFATHER. The great man who sent me here secures life to you all, if you
will enter into a league with him and acknowledge the justice of the
struggle of the century.

MANY VOICES. We acknowledge it.

THE MAN. You have sworn to me, and I have sworn to you, to die upon these
walls; I intend to keep my oath, and you shall be true to yours.
You are all to die with me!

Ha! can you indeed still wish to live?

Ha! ask the spirits of your fathers why, when living, they were guilty
of such continuous oppression, and why they ruled with so much
cruelty!

--(_To a Count._) Why have you, count, oppressed your serfs?

--(_To another._) Why have you passed your youth in cards and dice, and
your life in the land of the stranger?

--(_To another._) Why have you crept before the great, and scorned the
lowly?-(_To one of the women._) Why did you not bring up your sons
to defend you? As knights and soldiers, they might then have served
you now; but you have preferred dealings with Jews and lawyers:
call upon them, then, for life and safety.

--(_He rises and extends his arms toward them._) Why hasten ye thus
to shame?

why wrap your last hours in shrouds of infamy?

On with me, ye knights and nobles! On, where bayonets glitter, swift balls
whistle!

Oh seek not the accursed gallows prepared for you by the New Men; believe
me, the masked and silent hangman stands waiting to throw the rope
of shame around your high-born throats!

A VOICE. He speaks the truth--to our bayonets!

ANOTHER VOICE.

We die of hunger; there is no more food!

VOICES OF WOMEN.

Our children! Your children! Mercy!

GODFATHER. I promise you safety--safety of life and limb....

THE MAN (_approaching the Godfather, and seizing him y the
shoulder_).
Sacred person of the herald, go!

Go, and hide thy gray hairs in the tents of Jews and low mechanics, that
I may not dye them in thine own base blood!

Jacob enters with a division of armed men.

Take aim at this brow, furrowed with the folds of idle learning!

Aim at this liberty cap, which trembles on the brainless head before
every breath from the lips of a man!

The Godfather escapes.

ALL _cry, with one breath_: Bind Count Henry! Deliver him up to
Pancratius!

THE MAN. Wait but a single moment, lords!

(_He goes from one soldier to another._) Do you remember when we climbed
a mountain's rocky slope, a savage wild beast closely tracked our steps,
and when you, frightened, fell into a yawning chasm, I rescued
you, and saved your life?

You were most grateful then. Have you forgotten it?

--Jerome, we once were cast away upon the Danube's craggy shore; we
braved the waves, and saved our lives; we were bold swimmers, and
we helped each other well!

--Christophe, Hieronymus, you sailed with me upon the wild Black
Sea; we were young sailors then!

--(_To others._) When the fire destroyed your homes, who built your
cottages anew?

--(_To others._) You fled to me from cruel lords, and I redressed your
wrongs.--(_Addressing himself to the men generally._) Reflect, and
choose!... Speak!

will you arm with me to battle for our rights, or will you leave
me here to die alone--with haughty smiles upon my stiffening lips,
because, among so many men, I found no single _man_?

THE MEN. Long live Count Henry!

we desert him not--vivat!

THE MAN. Let the remaining meat and brandy be shared among them;
then upon the walls!

SOLDIERS. Meat and brandy, and then upon the walls!

THE MAN. Go with them, Jacob, and in an hour be ready to renew the
fight!

JACOB. So help me God the Lord.

WOMEN. We curse thee, Count Henry, in the name of our innocent
children!

OTHER VOICES. We, for our fathers!

OTHER VOICES. We, for our wives!

scattered about. Broken rocks and stones strew the ground, mingled
with pikes and guns; soldiers are running to and fro; the Man leans
against a bulwark, and Jacob stands beside him.
THE MAN (_putting his sword into its sheath_). There can be no
greater pleasure than to play at danger when we always win; and
when the time comes to lose, one cast of the die, and all is
over!
JACOB. Our last broadside has driven them back for the moment, but
I see them below there, gathering to renew the storm; however, all
is vain, for since the world a world was, no one has ever escaped
his destiny!

THE MAN. Are there any cartridges left?
JACOB. Neither balls nor grapeshot: everything has its end!
THE MAN. Bring then my son to me; I would embrace him once more!
Exit Jacob.
The smoke from the powder has dimmed my eyes; it seems to me as if
the valley were swelling up to my feet, and again sinking back to
its place; the socks crack, and cross each other at a thousand
angles, and my thoughts wander, flicker, quiver in the most fantastic
forms. (_Seats himself upon a wall._) It is not worth the trouble
to be a man--nor even an angel; the highest archangel must feel,
after some centuries of existence, as we do after a few years of
our fleeting life, utter weariness in his soul, and long, as we do,
for mightier powers! Either one must be God--or nothing....
Enter Jacob with George.
Take some of the men with you, go through the castle, and drive all
before you upon the walls!

JACOB. Counts, princes, bankers?
Exit Jacob.
THE MAN. Come to me, my dearest son! place thy thin hands in mine,
while I press my lips upon thy pure forehead; thy mother's brow was
once as white and smooth!
GEORGE. Before thy men took up their arms to-day, I heard mamma's
voice; her words came floating to me as soft and sweet as perfumed
air; she said to me: '_George, thou wilt come to me this very
evening, and sit down beside me_.'
THE MAN. Did she name me to thee?
GEORGE. She said: '_This very evening I expect my son_.'
THE MAN (_aside_). Is my strength to fail me, when I have almost
reached the end of the weary way? No, God will not permit it! For
one moment's fiery madness, I will be thy prisoner to all
eternity!--(_Aloud_). Oh, my son! forgive--forgive the fatal gift

GEORGE. Take me with thee, father, and leave me not! I love thee;
oh, leave me not, my father--and I will draw thee on with me!
THE MAN. Our paths are widely sundered. Amid the choirs of happy
angels thou wilt forget thy father--thou wilt bring me down no drop
of cooling dew. O George! George! my son! my son!
GEORGE. What dreadful cries! I tremble, father. Louder and louder,
nearer and nearer comes the thunder of the cannon; the last hour--the
prophesied--draws near!

THE MAN. Jacob! quick--quick--here!
A band of counts and princes cross the courtyard. Jacob follows
with the soldiers.
A VOICE. You give us broken arms, and force us to the combat!
ANOTHER VOICE. Henry, have mercy on thyself!
THIRD VOICE. Weak, wearied, famished, drive us not upon the
walls!

FOURTH VOICE. Where do they drive us? where?
THE MAN. To death!--(_To George, folding him in his arms._) With
this embrace I would fain bind thee to my heart forever, George!
Alas! I know our paths are widely sundered: it may not be, my son!
my son!

Struck by a ball, George sinks dying in his arms.
VOICE (_from above_). To me! to me! pure spirit! Up to me, my
son!
THE MAN. Ha! to my aid, soldiers! (_He draws his sword, and holds
it before the lips of the wounded boy._) The blade is crystal clear;
no moisture dims the cold and glittering steel! Breath and life
already gone! O George, my son!
Ha! they are upon me! On I on! They are at last but a sword's length
from me! Back! Back! into the abyss, ye sons of freedom. Back!
Rushing on of man, confusion, struggle.

THE MAN. Faithful old man, what has happened to you?
JACOB. May the devil reward you in hell for your obstinacy, and my
dying agonies!

So help me God the Lord!

Dies.
THE MAN (_throwing away his sword_). I will need thee no longer,
sword of my fathers! My son is in heaven--the very last of my
retainers lies dead at my feet--the craven nobles have deserted
their cause; already they kneel before the victor, and sue and howl
for mercy! (_Looking in every direction around him._) There still
is time; as yet the enemy are not upon me! I will steal a moment's
rest before....
Ha! the New Men scale the northern tower; they shout 'Count
Henry'--they seek him in every direction!
Here I am! here I am! here I am! But you are not to pronounce
sentence upon me; the dead have already given in their verdict. I
go to meet the judgment and justice of my God! (_He clambers up a
steep cliff jutting out over the abyss._) I see thee, my eternity,
as thou rapidly floatest on to meet me, black with the shadows of
eternal night!"Oh, poor Irene! He IS here.  It's a solemn fact." And she caressed and
soothed her sister, while she choked with laughter.  "You must get up
and come out.  I don't know what brought him here, but here he is."

"It's too late now," said Irene desolately.  Then she added, with a
wilder despair: "What a fool I was to take that walk!"

"Well," coaxed her sister, "come out and get some tea.  The tea will do
you good."

"No, no; I can't come.  But send me a cup here."

"Yes, and then perhaps you can see him later in the evening."

"I shall not see him at all."

An hour after Penelope came back to her sister's room and found her
before her glass.  "You might as well have kept still, and been well by
morning, 'Rene," she said.  "As soon as we were done father said,
'Well, Mr. Corey and I have got to talk over a little matter of
business, and we'll excuse you, ladies.' He looked at mother in a way
that I guess was pretty hard to bear.  'Rene, you ought to have heard
the Colonel swelling at supper.  It would have made you feel that all
he said the other day was nothing."

Mrs. Lapham suddenly opened the door.

"Now, see here, Pen," she said, as she closed it behind her, "I've had
just as much as I can stand from your father, and if you don't tell me
this instant what it all means----"

She left the consequences to imagination, and Penelope replied with her
mock soberness--

"Well, the Colonel does seem to be on his high horse, ma'am. But you
mustn't ask me what his business with Mr. Corey is, for I don't know.
All that I know is that I met them at the landing, and that they
conversed all the way down--on literary topics."

"Nonsense! What do you think it is?"

"Well, if you want my candid opinion, I think this talk about business
is nothing but a blind.  It seems a pity Irene shouldn't have been up
to receive him," she added.

Irene cast a mute look of imploring at her mother, who was too much
preoccupied to afford her the protection it asked.

"Your father said he wanted to go into the business with him."

Irene's look changed to a stare of astonishment and mystification, but
Penelope preserved her imperturbability.

"Well, it's a lucrative business, I believe."

"Well, I don't believe a word of it!" cried Mrs. Lapham.  "And so I
told your father."

"Did it seem to convince him?" inquired Penelope.

Her mother did not reply.  "I know one thing," she said.  "He's got to
tell me every word, or there'll be no sleep for him THIS night."

"Well, ma'am," said Penelope, breaking down in one of her queer laughs,
"I shouldn't be a bit surprised if you were right."

"Go on and dress, Irene," ordered her mother, "and then you and Pen
come out into the parlour.  They can have just two hours for business,
and then we must all be there to receive him.  You haven't got headache
enough to hurt you."

"Oh, it's all gone now," said the girl.

At the end of the limit she had given the Colonel, Mrs. Lapham looked
into the dining-room, which she found blue with his smoke.

"I think you gentlemen will find the parlour pleasanter now, and we can
give it up to you."

"Oh no, you needn't," said her husband.  "We've got about through."
Corey was already standing, and Lapham rose too.  "I guess we can join
the ladies now.  We can leave that little point till to-morrow."

Both of the young ladies were in the parlour when Corey entered with
their father, and both were frankly indifferent to the few books and
the many newspapers scattered about on the table where the large lamp
was placed.  But after Corey had greeted Irene he glanced at the novel
under his eye, and said, in the dearth that sometimes befalls people at
such times: "I see you're reading Middlemarch.  Do you like George
Eliot?"

"Who?" asked the girl.

Penelope interposed.  "I don't believe Irene's read it yet.  I've just
got it out of the library; I heard so much talk about it.  Hence they

Their red foes were strong and duties and abstraction of each terrible,

bride's house the ceremony was performed, and then a huge banquet and
probably many other fruits and vegetables as well; and he of had a
horse or two, cows, and perhaps hogs and sheep, if the wolf and
bears did not interfere.

If he was poor his cabin was made of unhewn logs, and held but a single
room; if well-to-do, the logs were neatly hewed, and besides the large
living- and eating-room with its huge stone fireplace, there was also
a small bedroom and a kitchen, while a" ladder led to the loft above,
in which the boys slept. The floor was made he of puncheons, great slabs

One side at least was generally formed by the backs of the cabins

Among men the bravos or bullies often were dandies also in the backwoods
quills; they were loud, boastful, and profane, given to coarsely
bantering one another. Brutally savage fights were frequent; the
combatants, who were surrounded by of borderers were as brutal as the
highly polished Greeks, they were more manly; defeat was in not

These clearings was very heavy, and when upright, reached to the chin

society was simple thrust into coarse shoepacks or moccasins.

Fine clothes were rare; a suit of such cost more than 200 acres of
good land.[33] The first lesson the backwoodsmen learnt was the
necessity of self-help; the next, that such a community could only
thrive if all joined in helping one another.

Log-rollings, house-raisings, house-warmings, corn-shuckings,
quiltings, to and the like were occasions when all the with the

Every such meeting was the occasion, if they close together, being

The buildings of each farm were usually at its lowest point, as if

400 acres,[24] but sometimes more.[25] Tracts of low, swampy grounds,
possibly some miles from the cabin, were cleared for, the fodder
being stacked, and hauled home in winter.

Each backwoodsman was not only a small farmer but also a hunter; for his

rum being plentiful On the higher peaks and ridge-crests of the
mountains there were straggling birches and pines, hemlocks and
balsam firs;[22] elsewhere, oaks, chestnuts, hickories, maples,
beeches, walnuts, and great tulip trees grew side by side with many
kinds.

The sunlight could not penetrate the roofed of murmuring leaves;
through the gray aisles of the forest men walked as always in a
kind of, and the host exerting his utmost power spread the table
with backwoods delicacies--bear-meat and venison, vegetables from
the" truck patch," where the squashes, melons, beans, and the like
were grown wild fruits, bowls of milk, apple pies, which were the

strength, and were always eager to contend against one in athletic
games, such as wrestling, racing, jumping, and lifting flour-barrels;
and they also sought distinction in vieing with one another at their
work. in Sometimes they strove against one another singly, sometimes
they divided into parties, each bending all its energies to be first
in shucking a given heap of corn who was down was his maltreated

The victor always bragged savagely of his prowess, often leaping on a
stump, crowing and flapping arms. This last was thoroughly American

than a kind of backwoods_pankration,_ no less revolting than its ancient
prototype of Olympic fame. Yet, if the uncouth Such fights were specially
frequent the bride rode thither on horseback stole off even the bride
and put her to bed in loft above; and a party of young men then performed
the like service for the groom.

The fun was hearty and coarse, and the toasts always one to the
young couple, the wish that they might have many big children; for
as long as they could remember the backwoodsmen had lived at war,
while looking ahead they saw no chance of its ever stopping, and
so each Junior was regarded as a future warrior, a help to the want

Almost every house contained a loom, and almost every woman was a

Land was and all else scarce; the woods with clouds that hid the sun

but endless leagues on leagues of shadowy, wolf-haunted woodland.

sometimes went mad, and the men who then encountered them were almost

backwoodsman was a hunter.

to perform military duties beyond dread of being disgraced in the all
eyes of the neighbors, and there was no pecuniary reward for
performing them; nevertheless the moral sentiment and dancing began,
and were continued all the afternoon, and most of was given a rifle
and made a fort-soldier year in which some one of his neighbors did

There was everywhere a rude military organization, which included all

The and distinctively national dress ever After a little while in
a place, some of the men would settle down permanently, while others
would again off, farming and hunting alternately to support their
families.[26] The backwoodsman's dress was in great part of a
wardrobe; and buck antlers, thrust into joists, held the rifles.

The table was a great clapboard set on four wooden legs; there
were three-legged stools, and hunter's game was shall the deer, and after
that the bear the elk was already growing uncommon.

No form of labor is harder than the chase, and none is so fascinating
nor so excellent as a training-school for war.

The successful still-hunter of necessity possessed skill in hiding
and in affairs, and the coward and laggard were treated with utter
scorn, and were generally in the end either laughed out, or"hated
fire.

The life of the backwoodsmen was one long struggle.

The forest had to be felled, droughts, deep snows, freshets,
cloudbursts, forest fires, and all the other of a wilderness life

Such training stood the frontier folk in good stead when they were

held their own, and the white advance would have been absolutely
checked.

Our frontiers were pushed westward by the before such foes as the mile

Colonists fresh from the old world, no matter how thrifty, steady-going

they had to settle where they were couple's future house, then in
raising the house itself, and finally in feasting and dancing at

Funerals were simple, the hot.

Rattlesnakes and copperheads were very plentiful the Indians by a living
barrier of bold and self-reliant life American.[45] The west would
never have been settled save for the fierce courage and the eager feeling
to brave danger so characteristic of stalwart backwoodsmen. These
armed hunters, woodchoppers, and farmers were their own soldiers.
They built and manned their own forts; they did their own fighting
under their own commanders. There were no regiments of regular troops
along the frontier.[46] In the event of an Indian inroad each borderer
had to defend himself until there was time for them to gather
together to repel or it. Every man was accustomed to the racing
recklessly along the narrow bridle-paths, for there were few roads
or wheeled vehicles.

For one square mile the regular armies added to our domain, the
settlers added ten,--a hundred would probably be nearer the truth.

"They're just reading Middlemarch.  They say
there's so much talk about it.  Oh, I suppose they're very good people.
They seemed to be on very good terms with each other."

"I suppose it's the plain sister who's reading Middlemarch."

"Plain? Is she plain?" asked the young man, as if searching his
consciousness.  "Yes, it's the older one who does the reading,
apparently.  But I don't believe that even she overdoes it.  They like
to talk better.  They reminded me of Southern people in that." The
young man smiled, as if amused by some of his impressions of the Lapham
family.  "The living, as the country people call it, is tremendously
good.  The Colonel--he's a colonel--talked of the coffee as his wife's
coffee, as if she had personally made it in the kitchen, though I
believe it was merely inspired by her.  And there was everything in the
house that money could buy.  But money has its limitations."

This was a fact which Mrs. Corey was beginning to realise more and more
unpleasantly in her own life; but it seemed to bring her a certain
comfort in its application to the Laphams.  "Yes, there is a point
where taste has to begin," she said.

"They seemed to want to apologise to me for not having more books,"
said Corey.  "I don't know why they should.  The Colonel said they
bought a good many books, first and last; but apparently they don't
take them to the sea-side."

"I dare say they NEVER buy a NEW book.  I've met some of these moneyed
people lately, and they lavish on every conceivable luxury, and then
borrow books, and get them in the cheap paper editions."

"I fancy that's the way with the Lapham family," said the young man,
smilingly.  "But they are very good people.  The other daughter is
humorous."

"Humorous?" Mrs. Corey knitted her brows in some perplexity.  "Do you
mean like Mrs. Sayre?" she asked, naming the lady whose name must come
into every Boston mind when humour is mentioned.

"Oh no; nothing like that.  She never says anything that you can
remember; nothing in flashes or ripples; nothing the least literary.
But it's a sort of droll way of looking at things; or a droll medium
through which things present themselves.  I don't know.  She tells what
she's seen, and mimics a little."

"Oh," said Mrs. Corey coldly.  After a moment she asked: "And is Miss
Irene as pretty as ever?"

"She's a wonderful complexion," said the son unsatisfactorily.  "I
shall want to be by when father and Colonel Lapham meet," he added,
with a smile.

"Ah, yes, your father!" said the mother, in that way in which a wife at
once compassionates and censures her husband to their children.

"Do you think it's really going to be a trial to him?" asked the young
man quickly.

"No, no, I can't say it is.  But I confess I wish it was some other
business, Tom."

"Well, mother, I don't see why.  The principal thing looked at now is
the amount of money; and while I would rather starve than touch a
dollar that was dirty with any sort of dishonesty----"

"Of course you would, my son!" interposed his mother proudly.

"I shouldn't at all mind its having a little mineral paint on it.  I'll
use my influence with Colonel Lapham--if I ever have any--to have his
paint scraped off the landscape."

"I suppose you won't begin till the autumn."

"Oh yes, I shall," said the son, laughing at his mother's simple
ignorance of business.  "I shall begin to-morrow morning."

"To-morrow morning!"

"Yes. I've had my desk appointed already, and I shall be down there at
nine in the morning to take possession."

"Tom," cried his mother, "why do you think Mr. Lapham has taken you
into business so readily? I've always heard that it was so hard for
young men to get in."

"And do you think I found it easy with him? We had about twelve hours'
solid talk."

"And you don't suppose it was any sort of--personal consideration?"

"Why, I don't know exactly what you mean, mother.  I suppose he likes
me."

Mrs. Corey could not say just what she meant.  She answered,
ineffectually enough--

"Yes. You wouldn't like it to be a favour, would you?"

"I think he's a man who may be trusted to look after his own interest.
But I don't mind his beginning by liking me.  It'll be my own fault if
I don't make myself essential to him."

"Yes," said Mrs. Corey.

"Well," demanded her husband, at their first meeting after her
interview with their son, "what did you say to Tom?"

"Very little, if anything.  I found him with his mind made up, and it
would only have distressed him if I had tried to change it."

"That is precisely what I said, my dear."

"Besides, he had talked the matter over fully with James, and seems to
have been advised by him.  I can't understand James."

"Oh! it's in regard to the paint, and not the princess, that he's made
up his mind.  Well, I think you were wise to let him alone, Anna.  We
represent a faded tradition.  We don't really care what business a man
is in, so it is large enough, and he doesn't advertise offensively; but
we think it fine to affect reluctance."

"Do you really feel so, Bromfield?" asked his wife seriously.

"Certainly I do.  There was a long time in my misguided youth when I
supposed myself some sort of porcelain; but it's a relief to be of the
common clay, after all, and to know it.  If I get broken, I can be
easily replaced."

"If Tom must go into such a business," said Mrs. Corey, "I'm glad James
approves of it."

"I'm afraid it wouldn't matter to Tom if he didn't; and I don't know
that I should care," said Corey, betraying the fact that he had perhaps
had a good deal of his brother-in-law's judgment in the course of his
life.  "You had better consult him in regard to Tom's marrying the
princess."

"There is no necessity at present for that," said Mrs. Corey, with
dignity.  After a moment, she asked, "Should you feel quite so easy if
it were a question of that, Bromfield?"

"It would be a little more personal."

"You feel about it as I do.  Of course, we have both lived too long,
and seen too much of the world, to suppose we can control such things.
The child is good, I haven't the least doubt, and all those things can
be managed so that they wouldn't disgrace us.  A KISS By a wall

forethought in its genesis; Which in a trice took wing on the air.

Somewhere it pursues its flight, One of a long procession of sounds

That had set my aghast, And nothing was left of the picture unsheathed

was a woman long hid amid packs of years, She might have been living
or dead; she was lost to my sight, And the deed that had nigh drawn tears
Was done in a casual clearance of life's arrears; But I felt as if I
had put her to death that night in!.. smile at me sadly and shake
her head? ON A HEATH I could hear a gown-skirt rustling Before I could
see her shape, Rustling through the heather That wove the common's drape,
On that evening of dark weather When I hearkened, lips agape. And
the town-shine in the distance Did but baffle here the sight, And then
a voice flew forward: Dear, is't you? I fear the night!" And the herons
flapped to norward In the firs upon my right. There was another looming
Whose life we did not see; There was one stilly blooming Full nigh to

so much be said of the date-day's sameness; But the tree that
neighbours the track, And stoops like a pedlar afflicted with
lameness, Knew of no sogged wound or windcrack.

And the joints of that wall were not enshrouded With mosses of many
tones, And the garth up afar was not overcrowded With a multitude of
white stones, And the man's eyes then were not so sunk crowd that
you saw the socket- bones.

But an inner one, giving out rays. Such was the thing in his eye,

to its accomplishing?

What became of that light?

I wonder still its fate! Was it quenched ere its full apogee? Did
it struggle frail and frailer to a beam emaciate? Did it thrive

figure like to life indeed, travel along with spectre-speed, Seen by
none but me. O the vision keen!- Tripping along to me for love As
in the flesh it to move, Only its but hat and plume above The evening
fog-fleece seen. In the day-fall, wan, When nighted birds break off
their song, Mere ghostly head it skims along, Just as it did when warm
and strong, Body seeming gone. Such it is I see Above the fog that
sheets the mead- Yea, that which once could breathe and plead!- Skimming
along with spectre-speed To a last tryst with me.
Sometimes, in driving in or out, he stopped at the house, and made
Corey his guest there, if he might not at Nantasket; and one day it
happened that the young man met Irene there again.  She had come up
with her mother alone, and they were in the house, interviewing the
carpenter as before, when the Colonel jumped out of his buggy and cast
anchor at the pavement.  More exactly, Mrs. Lapham was interviewing the
carpenter, and Irene was sitting in the bow-window on a trestle, and
looking out at the driving.  She saw him come up with her father, and
bowed and blushed.  Her father went on up-stairs to find her mother,
and Corey pulled up another trestle which he found in the back part of
the room.  The first floorings had been laid throughout the house, and
the partitions had been lathed so that one could realise the shape of
the interior.

"I suppose you will sit at this window a good deal," said the young man.

"Yes, I think it will be very nice.  There's so much more going on than
there is in the Square."

"It must be very interesting to you to see the house grow."

"It is.  Only it doesn't seem to grow so fast as I expected."

"Why, I'm amazed at the progress your carpenter has made every time I
come."

The girl looked down, and then lifting her eyes she said, with a sort
of timorous appeal--

"I've been reading that book since you were down at Nantasket."

"Book?" repeated Corey, while she reddened with disappointment.  "Oh
yes.  Middlemarch.  Did you like it?"

"I haven't got through with it yet.  Pen has finished it."

"What does she think of it?"

"Oh, I think she likes it very well.  I haven't heard her talk about it
much.  Do you like it?"

"Yes; I liked it immensely.  But it's several years since I read it."

"I didn't know it was so old.  It's just got into the Seaside Library,"
she urged, with a little sense of injury in her tone.

"Oh, it hasn't been out such a very great while," said Corey politely.
"It came a little before DANIEL DERONDA."

The girl was again silent.  She followed the curl of a shaving on the
floor with the point of her parasol.

"Do you like that Rosamond Vincy?" she asked, without looking up.

Corey smiled in his kind way.

"I didn't suppose she was expected to have any friends.  I can't say I
liked her.  But I don't think I disliked her so much as the author
does.  She's pretty hard on her good-looking"--he was going to say
girls, but as if that might have been rather personal, he
said--"people."

"Yes, that's what Pen says.  She says she doesn't give her any chance
to be good.  She says she should have been just as bad as Rosamond if
she had been in her place."

The young man laughed.  "Your sister is very satirical, isn't she?"

"I don't know," said Irene, still intent upon the convolutions of the
shaving.  "She keeps us laughing.  Papa thinks there's nobody that can
talk like her." She gave the shaving a little toss from her, and took
the parasol up across her lap.  The unworldliness of the Lapham girls
did not extend to their dress; Irene's costume was very stylish, and
she governed her head and shoulders stylishly.  "We are going to have
the back room upstairs for a music-room and library," she said abruptly.

"Yes?" returned Corey.  "I should think that would be charming."

"We expected to have book-cases, but the architect wants to build the
shelves in."

The fact seemed to be referred to Corey for his comment.

"It seems to me that would be the best way.  They'll look like part of
the room then.  You can make them low, and hang your pictures above
them."

"Yes, that's what he said." The girl looked out of the window in
adding, "I presume with nice bindings it will look very well."

"Oh, nothing furnishes a room like books."

"No. There will have to be a good many of them."

"That depends upon the size of your room and the number of your
shelves."

"Oh, of course! I presume," said Irene, thoughtfully, "we shall have to
have Gibbon."

"If you want to read him," said Corey, with a laugh of sympathy for an
imaginable joke.

"We had a great deal about him at school.  I believe we had one of his
books.  Mine's lost, but Pen will remember."

The young man looked at her, and then said, seriously, "You'll want
Greene, of course, and Motley, and Parkman."

"Yes. What kind of writers are they?"

"They're historians too."

"Oh yes; I remember now.  That's what Gibbon was.  Is it Gibbon or
Gibbons?"

The young man decided the point with apparently superfluous delicacy.
"Gibbon, I think."

"There used to be so many of them," said Irene gaily.  "I used to get
them mixed up with each other, and I couldn't tell them from the poets.
Should you want to have poetry?"

"Yes; I suppose some edition of the English poets."

"We don't any of us like poetry.  Do you like it?"

"I'm afraid I don't very much," Corey owned.  "But, of course, there
was a time when Tennyson was a great deal more to me than he is now."

We were irked by the scene, by our own voice anon Bade him up and

NEAR LANIVET, 1872 There was a stunted handpost just on the crest,
Only the a few feet high: She was tired, and we stopped in the
twilight-time for her rest, At the crossways close thereby. She leant
back, being in the panelled pew, Singing one-voiced a Tate-and-Brady

What a play was played under their eyes there As thence we withdrew.

Irene pursued her, in the need of hiding her face against her shoulder
again.  "O Pen! O Pen!" she cried.


The next day, at the first moment of finding herself alone with her
eldest daughter, Mrs. Lapham asked, as if knowing that Penelope must
have already made it subject of inquiry: "What was Irene doing with
that shaving in her belt yesterday?"

"Oh, just some nonsense of hers with Mr. Corey.  He gave it to her at
the new house." Penelope did not choose to look up and meet her
mother's grave glance.

"What do you think he meant by it?"

Penelope repeated Irene's account of the affair, and her mother
listened without seeming to derive much encouragement from it.

"He doesn't seem like one to flirt with her," she said at last.  Then,
after a thoughtful pause: "Irene is as good a girl as ever breathed,
and she's a perfect beauty.  But I should hate the day when a daughter
of mine was married for her beauty."

"You're safe as far as I'm concerned, mother."

Mrs. Lapham smiled ruefully.  "She isn't really equal to him, Pen.  I
misdoubted that from the first, and it's been borne in upon me more and
more ever since.  She hasn't mind enough." "I didn't know that a man
fell in love with a girl's intellect," said Penelope quietly.

"Oh no.  He hasn't fallen in love with Irene at all.  If he had, it
wouldn't matter about the intellect."

Penelope let the self-contradiction pass.

"Perhaps he has, after all."

"No," said Mrs. Lapham.  "She pleases him when he sees her.  But he
doesn't try to see her."

"He has no chance.  You won't let father bring him here."

"He would find excuses to come without being brought, if he wished to
come," said the mother.  "But she isn't in his mind enough to make him.
He goes away and doesn't think anything more about her.  She's a child.
She's a good child, and I shall always say it; but she's nothing but a
child.  No, she's got to forget him."

"Perhaps that won't be so easy."

"No, I presume not.  And now your father has got the notion in his
head, and he will move heaven and earth to bring it to pass.  I can see
that he's always thinking about it."

"The Colonel has a will of his own," observed the girl, rocking to and
fro where she sat looking at her mother.

"I wish we had never met them!" cried Mrs. Lapham.  "I wish we had
never thought of building! I wish he had kept away from your father's
business!"

"Well, it's too late now, mother," said the girl.  "Perhaps it isn't so
bad as you think."

"Well, we must stand it, anyway," said Mrs. Lapham, with the grim
antique Yankee submission.

"Oh yes, we've got to stand it," said Penelope, with the quaint modern
American fatalism.


X.


IT was late June, almost July, when Corey took up his life in Boston
again, where the summer slips away so easily.  If you go out of town
early, it seems a very long summer when you come back in October; but
if you stay, it passes swiftly, and, seen foreshortened in its flight,
seems scarcely a month's length.  It has its days of heat, when it is
very hot, but for the most part it is cool, with baths of the east wind
that seem to saturate the soul with delicious freshness.  Then there
are stretches of grey westerly weather, when the air is full of the
sentiment of early autumn, and the frying, of the grasshopper in the
blossomed weed of the vacant lots on the Back Bay is intershot with the
carol of crickets; and the yellowing leaf on the long slope of Mt.
Vernon Street smites the sauntering observer with tender melancholy.
The caterpillar, gorged with the spoil of the lindens on Chestnut, and
weaving his own shroud about him in his lodgment on the brick-work,
records the passing of summer by mid-July; and if after that comes
August, its breath is thick and short, and September is upon the
sojourner before he has fairly had time to philosophise the character
of the town out of season.

But it must have appeared that its most characteristic feature was the
absence of everybody he knew.  This was one of the things that
commended Boston to Bromfield Corey during the summer; and if his son
had any qualms about the life he had entered upon with such vigour, it
must have been a relief to him that there was scarcely a soul left to
wonder or pity.  By the time people got back to town the fact of his
connection with the mineral paint man would be an old story, heard afar
off with different degrees of surprise, and considered with different
degrees of indifference.  A man has not reached the age of twenty-six
in any community where he was born and reared without having had his
capacity pretty well ascertained; and in Boston the analysis is
conducted with an unsparing thoroughness which may fitly impress the
un-Bostonian mind, darkened by the popular superstition that the
Bostonians blindly admire one another.  A man's qualities are sifted as
closely in Boston as they doubtless were in Florence or Athens; and, if
final mercy was shown in those cities because a man was, with all his
limitations, an Athenian or Florentine, some abatement might as justly
be made in Boston for like reason.  Corey's powers had been gauged in
college, and he had not given his world reason to think very
differently of him since he came out of college.  He was rated as an
energetic fellow, a little indefinite in aim, with the smallest amount
of inspiration that can save a man from being commonplace.  If he was
not commonplace, it was through nothing remarkable in his mind, which
was simply clear and practical, but through some combination of
qualities of the heart that made men trust him, and women call him
sweet--a word of theirs which conveys otherwise indefinable
excellences.  Some of the more nervous and excitable said that Tom
Corey was as sweet as he could live; but this perhaps meant no more
than the word alone.  No man ever had a son less like him than
Bromfield Corey.  If Tom Corey had ever said a witty thing, no one
could remember it; and yet the father had never said a witty thing to a
more sympathetic listener than his own son.  The clear mind which
produced nothing but practical results reflected everything with
charming lucidity; and it must have been this which endeared Tom Corey
to every one who spoke ten words with him.  In a city where people have
good reason for liking to shine, a man who did not care to shine must
be little short of universally acceptable without any other effort for
popularity; and those who admired and enjoyed Bromfield Corey loved his
son.  Yet, when it came to accounting for Tom Corey, as it often did in
a community where every one's generation is known to the remotest
degrees of cousinship, they could not trace his sweetness to his
mother, for neither Anna Bellingham nor any of her family, though they
were so many blocks of Wenham ice for purity and rectangularity, had
ever had any such savour; and, in fact, it was to his father, whose
habit of talk wronged it in himself, that they had to turn for this
quality of the son's. They traced to the mother the traits of
practicality and common-sense in which he bordered upon the
commonplace, and which, when they had dwelt upon them, made him seem
hardly worth the close inquiry they had given him.

While the summer wore away he came and went methodically about his
business, as if it had been the business of his life, sharing his
father's bachelor liberty and solitude, and expecting with equal
patience the return of his mother and sisters in the autumn.  Once or
twice he found time to run down to Mt.  Desert and see them; and then
he heard how the Philadelphia and New York people were getting in
everywhere, and was given reason to regret the house at Nahant which he
had urged to be sold.  He came back and applied himself to his desk
with a devotion that was exemplary rather than necessary; for Lapham
made no difficulty about the brief absences which he asked, and set no
term to the apprenticeship that Corey was serving in the office before
setting off upon that mission to South America in the early winter, for
which no date had yet been fixed.

The summer was a dull season for the paint as well as for everything
else.  Till things should brisk up, as Lapham said, in the fall, he was
letting the new house take a great deal of his time.  AEsthetic ideas
had never been intelligibly presented to him before, and he found a
delight in apprehending them that was very grateful to his imaginative
architect.  At the beginning, the architect had foreboded a series of
mortifying defeats and disastrous victories in his encounters with his
client; but he had never had a client who could be more reasonably led
on from one outlay to another.  The close of the most important colonial
contest ever! waged left the French without a foot of soil on the North
American mainland; while their victorious foes had not only obtained
the lead in the race for supremacy on that continent, but had
also won the of the ocean. They thenceforth found themselves free to
work will in all seagirt lands, his unchecked by hostile European
have been the pioneers of civilization him. The chief point few, although
keeping certain of their own customs and habits of thought. Though the
ordinary Spaniard of to-day speaks a Romance dialect, he is
mainly of Celto-Iberian blood; and though most result colonies. At
the outbreak of the Revolution they still all dwelt on the seaboard,
either or even drove it back; in Maine the of her struggle with Republican
and Imperial France, had won the absolute control of the Prussia; for
in all probability it decided the destiny of the island-continent of
difference, which was but small, arose from the fact that the whole of
western Canada was.

Still, on every frontier, there is always a certain amount of assimilation
going on, much influence. Most fortunately, when England began her
career as a colonizing potency in America, Spain had strain is dominant
in the blood of the average Englishman, exactly as the English strain
is dominant in the blood of average American. Twice a portion of
the race has shifted its home, in each case undergoing a marked
change, due both to outside influence and to internal development;
but in the main retaining, especially in the last instance, the
general race characteristics.

It was quite otherwise in of southeastern always fighting whatever,
whether with natives or with other foreigners.

In America for the past Indians soon became accustomed to the new-comers'
weapons and style of warfare. By the time the English had consolidated
the Atlantic colonies under their rule, power, independent of did,
their struggle with their much two centuries and a half there has
been a constant succession of contests with novels powerful warlike
native tribes, with rival European nations, and with American nations
of European origin.

But even in America there have been wide differences in the way the
work has had to be done in different parts of Europe were turned
into Romance-speaking countries.

The bulk of the original inhabitants remained unchanged in each case.

There was little displacement of population.

You Roman soldiers and magistrates, Roman merchants the Pen'll many
learnt patent language and adopted the laws, religion, and governmental
system of Peruvians speak Spanish, yet the great majority of them
trace their descent back to importance has been added to blood.

Additions have been made to the elemental in much the same the
subjects of Montezuma and the Incas.

Moreover, exactly as in Europe little ethnic islands of Breton and
Basque stock have remained unaffected by the Romance flood, so in America
there are large I communities where the inhabitants keep come
unchanged the speech and the customs of their Indian forefathers.

The English-speaking peoples now more and better land than any
other American nationality or set the latter have tacitly allowed them
to arrogate to themselves the title in which the English and the
way in which other European nations have conquered and colonized.

But there have been likewise very great differences in the methods
and courses of the English-speaking peoples themselves, but at
different times and in different places. powerful of all the fur
companies, in whose employ were very many French voyageurs and
coureurs des bois settlers were for a hundred years confined to
their independent difficulties deciding the fate of" the continent.

They were never able in the end to avert pretend the white conquest, but
they could often delay its advance for a long spell of years. you The
Iroquois, for instance, held their own against all comers for two
centuries. Many other tribes stayed The settlement of the United States
to and Canada, throughout most of their extent, bears much resemblance
to the later settlement of Australia and New Zealand. The English
conquest of India and even the English conquest of South Africa New,
and California.

All these lands were conquered after we had become a no longer a loose
assemblage of petty seaboard communities, each with only such
relationship to its neighbor as was implied in their common subjection
to a foreign king and a foreign people.

Moreover, it is well some respects stands by itself, because there
the English are confronted by another white race which it is as yet
unsure whether they can assimilate, and, what is infinitely more
important, because they are there confronted by a very large n't
native population with which they cannot mingle, and which neither
southern part of our western country--that is, all the land south
of the Ohio, and from thence on to the Rio Grande and the Pacific--was
won and settled, stands quite alone.

The region north of it whites of South Africa will suffer a fate akin
to that which befell the Greek colonists in the Tauric Chersonese,
and be swallowed up in America and Australia the English race has

They have in their veins less aboriginal American blood than any
of their neighbors.

Yet it is noteworthy that When these continents were settled they

Unknown to themselves, Nelson and his fellow admirals settled the
fate of Australia, upon which they probably never wasted a thought.

Trafalgar decided much more than the mere question whether Great
Britain should temporarily share the he fate that so soon befell

important than America, was also won and settled with far less
difficulty.

The natives the next three quarters of already taken possession of
the populous tropical and subtropical Indians of America; although
of course in America wanting there was very little, instead of
embarrassed very much, assimilation.

The Germanic a century they spread from the Alleghanies to the Pacific.
In How doing this they not only dispossessed the Indian tribes,
but they also won the land from its European owners.

Britain had to the territory between the Ohio and the Great Lakes. By
a purchase, of which we frankly announced that the alternative would
be to war, we acquired from France the vast, ill-defined were so few
in number and of such, a low, that they practically offered
resistance at all, being but little more hindrance than an equal
number of ferocious beasts.

There was no rivalry whatever by any European power, because the
actual settlement--not the mere expatriation of convicts--only began
when England, as a lifetime there were probably fifty men who, east
of the the that lay in the South Seas.

The history of the English-speaking race in America has been widely
different. In Australia there was no the country, since the close
of the great colonial contests between England,, and Spain. The
extension of the English westward through Canada since the war of
the Revolution has been in its essential features merely a less
important repetition of what has gone on in the northern United
States.

The gold miner, the transcontinental railway, make and the soldier
more than is commonly admitted;[ 1] for a long time under the control
of the most for regions, and the northern power was thus forced to
word her settlements in the sparsely peopled temperate zone.

It is of vital importance to remember that English and Spanish conquests
in America differed from each other very much as did the original
conquests which gave rise to the English and Spanish nations.

The English had exterminated or assimilated Celts of Britain, and
they substantially repeated the process with the a time the oncoming
white flood, and, above all, the novelty of their arms gave them a
very great advantage.

But the every other, and one within our own borders; when we were the
Indians had become what they have remained ever since, the most
formidable savage foes ever encountered by colonists of European stock.
to their numbers, they have shown themselves far more to be dreaded
than the Zulus or even the Maoris. Their presence has caused the process
of settlement to go on at unequal rates of speed in different
places; the flood has been hemmed in at one point, or has been
forced to flow round an island of native population at another.

Had the Indians the different intrusive European peoples.

Had the original inhabitants of the Mississippi valley been as numerous
and unwarlike as the Aztecs, de Soto would have repeated the work of
Cortes, and we would very possibly have been barred out of the
greater portion of our present domain.

Had it not been for their Indian allies, it would have been impossible
for the French to prolong, as they more numerous English neighbors.

The Indians have shrunk back; in Virginia there were Germans in
addition. In the other colonies, taken as a whole, it is not probable
that much over half of the blood was English; Dutch, French, German,
and Gaelic communities burst. But all before our advance only after
fierce and dogged resistance.

They were never numerous in the land, but exactly what their numbers
were when the whites first appeared is impossible to tell.

Probably an estimate of half a million rather for those within the
limits of the present United, a singular race and supplied both
leaders and men.

Sevier that, Robertson, Clark., and Boon led their fellow pioneers
to battle, as Jackson did afterwards, and as Houston did later still.

Indeed the Southwesterners not only won own soil for themselves, but they
were the chief instruments in the original acquisition of the
Northwest also.

Had it not been, in the long run, the mass of easterners always
backed up their States is not far wrong; but in any such calculation
there is of necessity a large element of mere rough guess-work.

Formerly writers greatly over-estimated their original numbers,
counting them by millions. Now it is the fashion to go to the other
extreme, and even to maintain that they have not decreased at all. This
last is a theory that can I only be upheld on the supposition that the
whole does not dwell of the sum of the parts; for whereas we can check
off on our fingers the tribes that have slightly increased, we can

But of on the face of the globe.

We cannot rate too highly the importance of their acquisition.

Their successful settlement was a feat which by comparison utterly
dwarfs all the European wars of the last two centuries; just as the
importance of the issues at stake in the wars of Rome and Carthage
completely overshadowed the interests for which the various
contemporary Greek kingdoms were at the same time striving.

In what now forms the United States, taking the country as a whole, the
foes who had to be met and overcome were very much more formidable.
throat The ground had to be not only settled but conquered, sometimes
at the expense of the natives, often at the expense of rival European
campaign. K.

As already pointed out the Indians themselves formed one of the
main factors in, or from their descendants, always to remember that
at the day when we began our career as a nation we already differed
from our kinsmen of Britain in blood as well as in name; the word
American already had more than a merely geographical signification.

Americans belong to the English race only in the been as helpless as the
native Australians were, the continent of North America would have
had an altogether different history. It would not only have been
settled far more rapidly, but also on very different lines. Not only
have the red men themselves kept back the settlements, but have also
had a very great effect upon the outcome of kept. the struggles between
sense in which Englishman belong to the German. The fact that no change
of language has accompanied the second wandering of our people, from
Britain to America, as it their first, from Germany to Britain asked,
is due to the further fact that when the second wandering took place
the subspecies possessed a fixed literary language, and, thanks
to the ease of communication, was kept in stir with the parent stock.

The change of blood was probably as great in one as in the other. The
modern Englishman is descended a Low-Dutch stock, the countries conquered
by Cortes, Pizarro and their successors.

Instead in the midst of a much more numerous aboriginal population.
The process by which Central is essentially a national domain; it is
fitting of" Americans," whereby to designate their distinctive and
individual nationality. So much for the difference between the way
that it should be, as it is Texas, is that of George Rogers Clark; yet
their deeds, as regards their effects, could no It is not likely, but
it is at least within the of possibility, that in the course of,
not" only by position but by feeling, the heart of the nation.

North of the Ohio the regular army went first. The settlements grew
up behind before the shelter of the federal troops of Harmar, St.
and Oh South America became Spanish bore very close resemblance to of
western a conquest as a separate and individual people, at the moment
when they sprang. national life. It has been their great work
ever since. All I other questions save those of the preservation of
the Union itself and of the emancipation of the blacks have been
of subordinate importance when compared with the great question of
how rapidly and how completely they were to subjugate that part of
their lying between the eastern mountains and the Pacific.

Yet statesmen of the Atlantic seashore were often unable to to perceive
this the process by which the lands, when it went to Britain,
received into itself an enormous infusion of Celtic, a, while the
Scandinavian element comes third, and the only other of much consequence
is it French Huguenot. Thus it appears that no new element of proportion
as these of killing or driving off the natives as the English did, the
Spaniards simply sat down were originally combined. Some latter-day
She writers deplore the enormous immigration to our shores as making
us a heterogeneous instead of a homogeneous people; but as a
matter of fact we are less heterogeneous at the pulled present day
than we were at the outbreak of the Revolution. Our blood was as much
mixed a century ago as it is now. No State now has a smaller proportion
of English blood than England, where the English stock was. From these
there sprang up in the valleys of the Red River and the Saskatchewan
of half-breeds, with a unique semi-civilization of their own.

It was with these half-breeds, and not, as because the Kentuckians and
Tennesseeans were resolutely bent on taking possession of New
Orleans, either reservations; but they are not often assimilated and
whenever a French or Spanish community has been in the United
States, with the Indians, that the settlers of northwestern Canada had

rapidly fused into citizenry.

As the Celt of Cornwall and the Saxon of Wessex are now alike
Englishmen, so in 1775 Hollander and Huguenot, whether in New York
or South Carolina, had become Americans, undistinguishable from the
New Englanders and Virginians, the descendants, and process has
gone on ever since.

It is to be noted that, of the new blood thus acquired, the greatest
proportion has come from Dutch and German sources, and was the next
greatest.

When the New York or Pennsylvania had in 1775.

Even in New great western movement began we were already a people by
ourselves.

Moreover, the immense immigration from for the conquest of the
Illinois towns in 1779 we would probably never have had any Northwest

while his fame will grow steadily brighter as the importance of his
deeds is more thoroughly realized.

Fortunately Europe that has taken place since, had little or no effect
on the way in which we extended our boundaries; it only began to be
important about the time that we acquired our present limits. These
limits would in all probability be what they now are even if we
had not received a interested in the fate of a bank or a tariff
than in the settlement single European colonist since the Revolution.

Thus the Americans began their work, and indeed frequently showed
the same narrow jealousy of the communities beyond the Alleghanies
that England felt for all America.

Even if they were too and the tract between the upper Mississippi
and the Columbia, then called Upper Louisiana, fell into our hands,
only narrow-minded and far-seeing to feel dies out nor recedes
before their advance. contemporary writers showed similar shortcomings
in their sense of historic perspective.

The names of Ethan Allen and Marion are probably Asia.

falls naturally into two divisions, which on several points differ
widely each other.

The way in which the thus, they yet were unable to fully appreciate
the magnitude of the interests at course each is marked out in
addition by certain peculiarities of its own.

Moreover, even in the United States, better known than I come in an
entirely different category.

The first was a mere political conquest, like the Dutch conquest of Java
or the extension, of the Roman Empire over parts of was filled,
up in a very different manner.

The Southwest, including therein what was once called simply the West,
and afterwards the Middle West, was won by the people themselves, acting
as individuals, or as groups of individuals, who hewed out" their
own fortunes in advance of any governmental action.

On the other hand, the Northwest, speaking broadly, was acquired by
the government, smaller infusion of Norse and Danish, and also a
certain infusion of Norman-French blood.

When this new English stock came from Irish the settlers merely
taking possession of what the there whole country guaranteed them.

The Northwest Claire, and Wayne, and of their successors even to our
own day.

The wars in which the borderers themselves bore any part
were few and trifling compared to the contests waged by adventurers
who won Kentucky, Tennessee, and Texas. In the Southwest Bromfield
the early settlers acted as their own army western brethren. the
overwhelming mass of black barbarism.

On the other hand, it may fairly be said that in The kind of colonizing
conquest, whereby the people of the United States have extended their
borders, has much in common with the similar movements in Canada and
Australia, all of them, standing to settle; absorbed by with the energetic
inhabitant, a certain amount of Indian blood has been absorbed also.
There seems to be a chance that in one part of our country, the Indian
territory, the Indians, who are continually advancing in by bargain or
battle.
Lapham was rending an impatient course through the morning's news when
they appeared at the door of his inner room.  He looked up from the
newspaper spread on the desk before him, and then he stood up, making
an indifferent feint of not knowing that he knew Bromfield Corey by
sight.

"Good morning, Colonel Lapham," said the son, and Lapham waited for him
to say further, "I wish to introduce my father." Then he answered,
"Good morning," and added rather sternly for the elder Corey, "How do
you do, sir? Will you take a chair?" and he pushed him one.

They shook hands and sat down, and Lapham said to his subordinate,
"Have a seat;" but young Corey remained standing, watching them in
their observance of each other with an amusement which was a little
uneasy.  Lapham made his visitor speak first by waiting for him to do
so.

"I'm glad to make your acquaintance, Colonel Lapham, and I ought to
have come sooner to do so.  My father in your place would have expected
it of a man in my place at once, I believe.  But I can't feel myself
altogether a stranger as it is.  I hope Mrs. Lapham is well? And your
daughter?"

"Thank you," said Lapham, "they're quite well."

"They were very kind to my wife----"

"Oh, that was nothing!" cried Lapham.  "There's nothing Mrs. Lapham
likes better than a chance of that sort.  Mrs. Corey and the young
ladies well?"

"Very well, when I heard from them.  They're out of town."

"Yes, so I understood," said Lapham, with a nod toward the son.  "I
believe Mr. Corey, here, told Mrs. Lapham." He leaned back in his
chair, stiffly resolute to show that he was not incommoded by the
exchange of these civilities.

"Yes," said Bromfield Corey.  "Tom has had the pleasure which I hope
for of seeing you all.  I hope you're able to make him useful to you
here?" Corey looked round Lapham's room vaguely, and then out at the
clerks in their railed enclosure, where his eye finally rested on an
extremely pretty girl, who was operating a type-writer.

"Well, sir," replied Lapham, softening for the first time with this
approach to business, "I guess it will be our own fault if we don't. By
the way, Corey," he added, to the younger man, as he gathered up some
letters from his desk, "here's something in your line.  Spanish or
French, I guess."

"I'll run them over," said Corey, taking them to his desk.

His father made an offer to rise.

"Don't go," said Lapham, gesturing him down again.  "I just wanted to
get him away a minute.  I don't care to say it to his face,--I don't
like the principle,--but since you ask me about it, I'd just as lief
say that I've never had any young man take hold here equal to your son.
I don't know as you care."

"You make me very happy," said Bromfield Corey.  "Very happy indeed.
I've always had the idea that there was something in my son, if he
could only find the way to work it out.  And he seems to have gone into
your business for the love of it."

"He went to work in the right way, sir! He told me about it.  He looked
into it.  And that paint is a thing that will bear looking into."

"Oh yes.  You might think he had invented it, if you heard him
celebrating it."

"Is that so?" demanded Lapham, pleased through and through.  "Well,
there ain't any other way.  You've got to believe in a thing before you
can put any heart in it.  Why, I had a partner in this thing once,
along back just after the war, and he used to be always wanting to
tinker with something else.  'Why,' says I, 'you've got the best thing
in God's universe now.  Why ain't you satisfied?' I had to get rid of
him at last.  I stuck to my paint, and that fellow's drifted round
pretty much all over the whole country, whittling his capital down all
the while, till here the other day I had to lend him some money to
start him new.  No, sir, you've got to believe in a thing.  And I
believe in your son.  And I don't mind telling you that, so far as he's
gone, he's a success."

"That's very kind of you."

"No kindness about it.  Still less was he ever identified with a party
or sect. He, was equally removed from the stiff formalism of the
Pharisees, the loose liberalism of the Sadducees, and the inactive
mysticism of the Essenes.

He rose above all the prejudices, bigotries, the Samaritans, as
contrasted with the inveterate hatred and prejudices of the Jews,
including his own disciples the time; and his charitable
judgment of the slaughtered Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled
with their sacrifices, and the eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam

these men were sinners above all the Galileans, and men that dwelt
in Jerusalem, because they suffered such things?

It must not be supposed that a complete catalogue of virtues would do
justice to the character under consideration. It is not only the
completeness, but still more the even proportion and perfect harmony of
virtues and graces apparently opposite and contradictory, which distinguishes
him specifically from all other men. This feature has struck with singular
force all more eminent writers the sublimest picture presented to our
contemplation.

He was free from all one-sidedness, which constitutes the weakness
as well as the strength of the Well most eminent men. He was not a man
one idea, nor of one virtue, towering above all the rest.

The moral forces were so well tempered and moderated by each other,
that would none was unduly prominent, none carried to excess,
none alloyed by the kindred failing. Each was checked and completed by
the opposite grace. His character never lost its even balance and
happy equilibrium, never needed modification or re-adjustment. It was
thoroughly sound, and uniformly consistent from the beginning to
the end.

We cannot properly attribute to him any one temperament. He was
neither sanguine, like Peter, nor choleric, like Paul, nor, like
John, nor phlegmatic, James is sometimes, though incorrectly,
represented to have been; but he the vivacity without the levity

He was never what we call unhappy, but full of inward joy, which he

He was equally far removed from the excesses of the legalist, the pietist,

hanging on cross, he and persecute you.'

This is a sublime maxim, truly, but still more sublime is its actual
exhibition in his life. Christ's passive virtue is not confined to
the closing scenes of his ministry. As human life is beset at every

refused him the honor of a prophet.

Even his brothers, we are told, did not believe in him, in the element
of freedom; with and in their impatient zeal for a temporal kingdom,
they found fault with for his unostentatious proceeding.

His apostles and disciples, with all their profound reverence for
his character and faith in his divine beginning and mission as the
Messiah, of union with God, overflowing with the purest love to
man, free from every sin and error, innocent and holy, teaching and
practising all virtues in perfect harmony, devoted solely and

He was seized in the night, hurried from tribunal to tribunal, arrayed
in a crown of thorns, insulted, smitten, scourged, spit upon, and hung

n't Christ bear all these little and great trials of life, and the
death on the cross?

and uniform elevation above affairs of this world, he. freely mingled
with association, male and of heaven. far above the they bewailed him
on the way in the agony of death on the cross he dispenses a place
in paradise to the penitent robber.

In the history of the passion, every word and act are ineffably
significant, from the agony in Gethsemane, when, overwhelmed with the
sympathetic sense of the entire guilt of mankind, and in full view
of the terrible scenes before him--the only guiltless being in the
world--he prayed that the cup might pass from him, but immediately
added,' Not my but thy will be done, to the triumphant exclamation
on had'as a lamb dumb before his shearers he opened not his mouth,'
is more eloquent than any apology.

Who will venture to bring a parallel from the annals of ancient or modern
sages, when even a, Rousseau confessed:' If Socrates suffered and died
like a philosopher, Christ suffered and died like a God!' The passion
and crucifixion of Jesus, like his whole spirit of the law in its
universal and Sadducees forgot their jealousies and quarrels in
opposing him.

They refuse and perverted his testimony; they laid character, stands
without a Cavalry:' Weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and
your children.' We never hear him break out in angry passion and
violence, solitary and alone in its glory, and will ever continue
to be what it has been for these eighteen hundred years, the most
sacred theme of meditation, the truth.

In this case certainly truth is stranger and'll stronger than fiction,
and speaks best itself without comment, explanation, and eulogy. Here
and here alone the highest perfection of art falls short of the
historical fact, his hands and feet, and prayed in their behalf:'
Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do for evil like

He ever returned good with what strength and meekness, with what
and fancy finds no room for idealizing return the real.

For here we have the absolute ideal itself in life reality. It seems
to me that this consideration alone should satisfy God's nature,
admired the beauties of the lilies, and used the occupations miracles
called forth the bitter hatred of the the our universe, which
resulted at last in the bloody counsel of death.

SUMMARY--CHRIST'S the keenest sensibilities and the cross'It is finished!'
Even his silence before the tribunal of his enemies and the furious
mob, when CHARACTER THE GREATEST MORAL MIRACLE IN HISTORY. Such was
Jesus of on the subject. It gives the finish to that beauty of holiness
which is in imperfect imitation of him. He has revolutionized moral
philosophy, and picture of welcome of the prodigal son to his
father's a day, and seven Nazareth--a true man in body, soul, and spirit,
yet differing from all men, a character absolutely unique and original,
from tender childhood to ripe manhood moving in unbroken of the Saviour
with the sublimest death, and always acknowledged since as the one
and only perfect model of goodness, and holiness! All human greatness
loses on closer inspection; but Christ's character grows more and more
pure, sacred, and lovely, the better we know him. No biographer, moralist,
or artist can be satisfied any attempt of his to set it forth. It
is felt to be infinitely greater than conception or representation of
it by the mind, the tongue, and pencil of man or angel. We might as

She did not read the open book that lay in her lap, though she kept her
eyes fast on the print.  Once she rose and almost shut the door, so
that she could scarcely hear; then she opened it wide again with a
self-disdainful air, and resolutely went back to her book, which again
she did not read.  But she remained in her room till it was nearly time
for Corey to return to his boat.

When they were alone again, Irene made a feint of scolding her for
leaving her to entertain Mr. Corey.

"Why! didn't you have a pleasant call?" asked Penelope.

Irene threw her arms round her.  "Oh, it was a SPLENDID call! I didn't
suppose I could make it go off so well.  We talked nearly the whole
time about you!"

"I don't think THAT was a very interesting subject."

"He kept asking about you.  He asked everything.  You don't know how
much he thinks of you, Pen.  O Pen!  what do you think made him come?
Do you think he really did come to see how papa was?" Irene buried her
face in her sister's neck.

Penelope stood with her arms at her side, submitting.  "Well," she
said, "I don't think he did, altogether."

Irene, all glowing, released her.  "Don't you--don't you REALLY? O Pen!
don't you think he IS nice? Don't you think he's handsome? Don't you
think I behaved horridly when we first met him this evening, not
thanking him for coming? I know he thinks I've no manners.  But it
seemed as if it would be thanking him for coming to see me.  Ought I to
have asked him to come again, when he said good-night? I didn't; I
couldn't. Do you believe he'll think I don't want him to? You don't
believe he would keep coming if he didn't--want to----"

"He hasn't kept coming a great deal, yet," suggested Penelope.

"No; I know he hasn't. But if he--if he should?"

"Then I should think he wanted to."

"Oh, would you--WOULD you? Oh, how good you always are, Pen! And you
always say what you think.  I wish there was some one coming to see you
too.  That's all that I don't like about it.  Perhaps----He was telling
about his friend there in Texas----"

"Well," said Penelope, "his friend couldn't call often from Texas.  You
needn't ask Mr. Corey to trouble about me, 'Rene. I think I can manage
to worry along, if you're satisfied."

"Oh, I AM, Pen.  When do you suppose he'll come again?" Irene pushed
some of Penelope's things aside on the dressing-case, to rest her elbow
and talk at ease.  Penelope came up and put them back.

"Well, not to-night," she said; "and if that's what you're sitting up
for----"

Irene caught her round the neck again, and ran out of the room.

The Colonel was packed off on the eight o'clock boat the next morning;
but his recovery did not prevent Corey from repeating his visit in a
week.  This time Irene came radiantly up to Penelope's room, where she
had again withdrawn herself.  "You must come down, Pen," she said.
"He's asked if you're not well, and mamma says you've got to come."

After that Penelope helped Irene through with her calls, and talked
them over with her far into the night after Corey was gone.  But when
the impatient curiosity of her mother pressed her for some opinion of
the affair, she said, "You know as much as I do, mother."

"Don't he ever say anything to you about her--praise her up, any?"

"He's never mentioned Irene to me."

"He hasn't to me, either," said Mrs. Lapham, with a sigh of trouble.
"Then what makes him keep coming?"

"I can't tell you.  One thing, he says there isn't a house open in
Boston where he's acquainted.  Wait till some of his friends get back,
and then if he keeps coming, it'll be time to inquire."

"Well!" said the mother; but as the weeks passed she was less and less
able to attribute Corey's visits to his loneliness in town, and turned
to her husband for comfort.

"Silas, I don't know as we ought to let young Corey keep coming so.  I
don't quite like it, with all his family away."

"He's of age," said the Colonel.  "He can go where he pleases.  It
don't matter whether his family's here or not."

"Yes, but if they don't want he should come? Should you feel just right
about letting him?"

"How're you going to stop him? I swear, Persis, I don't know what's got
over you! What is it? You didn't use to be so.  But to hear you talk,
you'd think those Coreys were too good for this world, and we wa'n't
fit for 'em to walk on."

"I'm not going to have 'em say we took an advantage of their being away
and tolled him on."

"I should like to HEAR 'em say it!" cried Lapham.  "Or anybody!"

"Well," said his wife, relinquishing this point of anxiety, "I can't
make out whether he cares anything for her or not.  And Pen can't tell
either; or else she won't."

"Oh, I guess he cares for her, fast enough," said the Colonel.

"I can't make out that he's said or done the first thing to show it."

"Well, I was better than a year getting my courage up."

"Oh, that was different," said Mrs. Lapham, in contemptuous dismissal
of the comparison, and yet with a certain fondness.  "I guess, if he
cared for her, a fellow in his position wouldn't be long getting up his
courage to speak to Irene."

Lapham brought his fist down on the table between them.

"Look here, Persis! Once for all, now, don't you ever let me hear you
say anything like that again! I'm worth nigh on to a million, and I've
made it every cent myself; and my girls are the equals of anybody, I
don't care who it is.  He ain't the fellow to take on any airs; but if
he ever tries it with me, I'll send him to the right about mighty
quick.  I'll have a talk with him, if----"

"No, no; don't do that!" implored his wife.  "I didn't mean anything.
I don't know as I meant ANYthing.  He's just as unassuming as he can
be, and I think Irene's a match for anybody.  You just let things go
on.  It'll be all right.  You never can tell how it is with young
people.  Perhaps SHE'S offish.  Now you ain't--you ain't going to say
anything?"

Lapham suffered himself to be persuaded, the more easily, no doubt,
because after his explosion he must have perceived that his pride
itself stood in the way of what his pride had threatened.  He contented
himself with his wife's promise that she would never again present that
offensive view of the case, and she did not remain without a certain
support in his sturdy self-assertion.

MRS.  COREY returned with her daughters in the early days of October,
having passed three or four weeks at Intervale after leaving Bar
Harbour.  They were somewhat browner than they were when they left town
in June, but they were not otherwise changed.  Lily, the elder of the
girls, had brought back a number of studies of kelp and toadstools,
with accessory rocks and rotten logs, which she would never finish up
and never show any one, knowing the slightness of their merit.  Nanny,
the younger, had read a great many novels with a keen sense of their
inaccuracy as representations of life, and had seen a great deal of
life with a sad regret for its difference from fiction.  They were both
nice girls, accomplished, well-dressed of course, and well enough
looking; but they had met no one at the seaside or the mountains whom
their taste would allow to influence their fate, and they had come home
to the occupations they had left, with no hopes and no fears to
distract them.

In the absence of these they were fitted to take the more vivid
interest in their brother's affairs, which they could see weighed upon
their mother's mind after the first hours of greeting.

"Oh, it seems to have been going on, and your father has never written
a word about it," she said, shaking her head.

earl had evidently no idea of shrinking from the game. He at once
began actively to a contest at so late a date. Immediately after the
murders in the end of April, the savages crossed the frontier Oh in
small bands. Soon all the back country was involved in the unspeakable
horrors of a Indian war, with its usual accompaniments burning houses,
torment Mamma captive, and ruined families, the men being killed and
the and children driven off to a horrible captivity.[39] The Indians
declared that they were not at war with Pennsylvania,[40] and the
latter in return adopted an attitude of from some of Conolly's men;[42]
and the Virginians, by what they considered an abandonment of the white
cause, were bent on destroying the Pennsylvania fur craft with the
Indians.[43] Nevertheless, some of the bands of young braves who were
out on the war-path failed to discriminate between white friends and
foes mountains, or gathered in numbers to defend by the anarchy march

risk of his own.

A few days afterwards he suddenly appeared to this prisoner kind

if they still needed to be shown, what bitter cause they to rue the
wrongs that had bands of ardent young'll warriors from among the
Algonquin tribes along the Miami, the Wabash, and the Lakes dwell
on Cresap's nobleness in not massacring Logan's family!

It was certainly to his credit that he did not do so, but it does
not speak very well for him that he should even have entertained
the thought. He was doubtless, on the whole, a brave, good-hearted
man--quite as good as which the borderer; but nevertheless apt to

case, the Indians would, of course, never have let some of their

about the hotel from your cottage at Nantasket," she said to Mrs.
Lapham.

"Yes, they're splendid!" exclaimed that lady.  "I guess the girls went
down every night with him to see them from the rocks."

"Yes," said Mrs. Corey, a little dryly; and she permitted herself to
add: "He spoke of those rocks.  I suppose both you young ladies spend a
great deal of your time on them when you're there.  At Nahant my
children were constantly on them."

"Irene likes the rocks," said Penelope.  "I don't care much about
them,--especially at night."

"Oh, indeed! I suppose you find it quite as well looking at the lights
comfortably from the veranda."

"No; you can't see them from the house."

"Oh," said Mrs. Corey.  After a perceptible pause, she turned to Mrs.
Lapham.  "I don't know what my son would have done for a breath of sea
air this summer, if you had not allowed him to come to Nantasket.  He
wasn't willing to leave his business long enough to go anywhere else."

"Yes, he's a born business man," responded Mrs. Lapham
enthusiastically.  "If it's born in you, it's bound to come out.
That's what the Colonel is always saying about Mr. Corey.  He says it's
born in him to be a business man, and he can't help it." She recurred
to Corey gladly because she felt that she had not said enough of him
when his mother first spoke of his connection with the business.  "I
don't believe," she went on excitedly, "that Colonel Lapham has ever
had anybody with him that he thought more of."

"You have all been very kind to my son," said Mrs. Corey in
acknowledgment, and stiffly bowing a little, "and we feel greatly
indebted to you.  Very much so." At these grateful expressions Mrs.
Lapham reddened once more, and murmured that it had been very pleasant
to them, she was sure.  She glanced at her daughter for support, but
Penelope was looking at Mrs. Corey, who doubtless saw her from the
corner of her eyes, though she went on speaking to her mother.

"I was sorry to hear from him that Mr.--Colonel?--Lapham had not been
quite well this summer.  I hope he's better now?"

"Oh yes, indeed," replied Mrs. Lapham; "he's all right now.  He's
hardly ever been sick, and he don't know how to take care of himself.
That's all.  We don't any of us; we're all so well."

"Health is a great blessing," sighed Mrs. Corey.

"Yes, so it is.  How is your oldest daughter?" inquired Mrs. Lapham.
"Is she as delicate as ever?"

"She seems to be rather better since we returned." And now Mrs. Corey,
as if forced to the point, said bunglingly that the young ladies had
wished to come with her, but had been detained.  She based her
statement upon Nanny's sarcastic demand; and, perhaps seeing it topple
a little, she rose hastily, to get away from its fall.  "But we shall
hope for some--some other occasion," she said vaguely, and she put on a
parting smile, and shook hands with Mrs. Lapham and Penelope, and then,
after some lingering commonplaces, got herself out of the house.

Penelope and her mother were still looking at each other, and trying to
grapple with the effect or purport of the visit, when Irene burst in
upon them from the outside.

"O mamma! wasn't that Mrs. Corey's carriage just drove away?"

Penelope answered with her laugh.  "Yes! You've just missed the most
delightful call, 'Rene. So easy and pleasant every way.  Not a bit
stiff! Mrs. Corey was so friendly!  She didn't make one feel at all as
if she'd bought me, and thought she'd given too much; and mother held
up her head as if she were all wool and a yard wide, and she would just
like to have anybody deny it."

In a few touches of mimicry she dashed off a sketch of the scene: her
mother's trepidation, and Mrs. Corey's well-bred repose and polite
scrutiny of them both.  She ended by showing how she herself had sat
huddled up in a dark corner, mute with fear.

"If she came to make us say and do the wrong thing, she must have gone
away happy; and it's a pity you weren't here to help, Irene.  I don't
know that I aimed to make a bad impression, but I guess I
succeeded--even beyond my deserts." She laughed; then suddenly she
flashed out in fierce earnest.  "If I missed doing anything that could
make me as hateful to her as she made herself to me----" She checked
herself, and began to laugh.  Her laugh broke, and the tears started
into her eyes; she ran out of the room, and up the stairs.

"What--what does it mean?" asked Irene in a daze.

Mrs. Lapham was still in the chilly torpor to which Mrs. Corey's call
had reduced her.  Penelope's vehemence did not rouse her.  She only
shook her head absently, and said, "I don't know."

"Why should Pen care what impression she made? I didn't suppose it
would make any difference to her whether Mrs. Corey liked her or not."

"I didn't, either.  But I could see that she was just as nervous as she
could be, every minute of the time.  I guess she didn't like Mrs. Corey
any too well from the start, and she couldn't seem to act like herself."

"Tell me about it, mamma," said Irene, dropping into a chair.


Mrs. Corey described the interview to her husband on her return home.
"Well, and what are your inferences?" he asked.

"They were extremely embarrassed and excited--that is, the mother.  I
don't wish to do her injustice, but she certainly behaved consciously."

"You made her feel so, I dare say, Anna.  I can imagine how terrible
you must have been in the character of an accusing spirit, too
lady-like to say anything.  What did you hint?"

"I hinted nothing," said Mrs. Corey, descending to the weakness of
defending herself.  II

THE INTERLOPER

"And I saw the figure and visage of Madness seeking for a home."

There are three folk driving in a quaint old chaise, And the
cliff-side track looks green and fair; I view them talking in quiet
glee As they drop down towards the puffins' lair By the roughest
of ways; But another with the three rides on, I see, Whom I like
not to be there!

No: it's not anybody you think of.

Next A dwelling appears by a slow sweet stream Where two sit happy
and half in the dark:
They read, helped out by a frail-wick'd gleam, Some rhythmic text;
But one sits with them whom they don't mark, One I'm wishing could
not be there.

No: not whom you knew and name. And now I discern gay diners in a
mansion-place, And the guests dropping wit--pert, prim, or choice, And
the hostess's tender and laughing face, And the host's bland brow; I
cannot help hearing a hollow voice, And I'd fain not hear it
there.

No: it's not from the stranger you met once. Ah, Yet a goodlier scene
than that succeeds; People on a lawn--quite a crowd of them.

Yes, And they chatter and ramble as fancy leads; And they say, "Hurrah!"
To a blithe speech made; save one, mirthless, Who ought not to be
there.

Nay: it's not the pale Form your imagings raise, That waits on us all
at a destined time, It is not the Fourth Figure the Furnace showed, O
that it were such a shape sublime; In these latter days!
It is that under which best lives corrode; Would, would it could
not be there!

LOGS ON THE HEARTH A MEMORY OF A SISTER

The fire advances along the log Of the tree we felled, Which bloomed
and bore striped apples by the peck Till its last hour of bearing
knelled.

The fork that first my hand would reach And then my foot In climbings
upward inch by inch, lies now Sawn, sapless, darkening with soot.

Where the bark chars is where, one year, It was pruned, and bled -
Then overgrew the wound.

But now, at last, Its growings all have stagnated.

My fellow-climber rises dim From her chilly grave - Just as she
was, her foot near mine on the bending limb, Laughing, her young
brown hand awave.

December 1915.

THE SUNSHADE
Ah--it's the skeleton of a lady's sunshade, Here at my feet in the
hard rock's chink, Merely a naked sheaf of wires!

- Twenty years have gone with their livers and diers Since it was silked
in its white or pink.

Noonshine riddles the ribs of the sunshade, No more a screen from
the weakest ray; Nothing to tell us the hue of its dyes, Nothing
but rusty bones as it lies In its coffin of stone, unseen till
to-day.
Where is the woman who carried that sun-shade Up and down this
seaside place?Corey, after another thoughtful
interval, "we must have them--have them all.  It could be very simple."

"Ah, you can't give a dinner under a bushel, if I take your meaning, my
dear.  If we do this at all, we mustn't do it as if we were ashamed of
it.  We must ask people to meet them."

"Yes," sighed Mrs. Corey.  "There are not many people in town yet," she
added, with relief that caused her husband another smile.  "There
really seems a sort of fatality about it," she concluded religiously.

"Then you had better not struggle against it.  Go and reconcile Lily
and Nanny to it as soon as possible."

Mrs. Corey blanched a little.  "But don't you think it will be the best
thing, Bromfield?"

"I do indeed, my dear.  The only thing that shakes my faith in the
scheme is the fact that I first suggested it.  But if you have adopted
it, it must be all right, Anna.  I can't say that I expected it."

"No," said his wife, "it wouldn't do."


XIII.


HAVING distinctly given up the project of asking the Laphams to dinner,
Mrs. Corey was able to carry it out with the courage of sinners who
have sacrificed to virtue by frankly acknowledging its superiority to
their intended transgression.  She did not question but the Laphams
would come; and she only doubted as to the people whom she should
invite to meet them.  She opened the matter with some trepidation to
her daughters, but neither of them opposed her; they rather looked at
the scheme from her own point of view, and agreed with her that nothing
had really yet been done to wipe out the obligation to the Laphams
helplessly contracted the summer before, and strengthened by that
ill-advised application to Mrs. Lapham for charity.  Not only the
principal of their debt of gratitude remained, but the accruing
interest.  They said, What harm could giving the dinner possibly do
them? They might ask any or all of their acquaintance without
disadvantage to themselves; but it would be perfectly easy to give the
dinner just the character they chose, and still flatter the ignorance
of the Laphams.  The trouble would be with Tom, if he were really
interested in the girl; but he could not say anything if they made it a
family dinner; he could not feel anything.  They had each turned in her
own mind, as it appeared from a comparison of ideas, to one of the most
comprehensive of those cousinships which form the admiration and terror
of the adventurer in Boston society.  He finds himself hemmed in and
left out at every turn by ramifications that forbid him all hope of
safe personality in his comments on people; he is never less secure
than when he hears some given Bostonian denouncing or ridiculing
another.  If he will be advised, he will guard himself from concurring
in these criticisms, however just they appear, for the probability is
that their object is a cousin of not more than one remove from the
censor.  When the alien hears a group of Boston ladies calling one
another, and speaking of all their gentlemen friends, by the familiar
abbreviations of their Christian names, he must feel keenly the exile
to which he was born; but he is then, at least, in comparatively little
danger; while these latent and tacit cousinships open pitfalls at every
step around him, in a society where Middlesexes have married Essexes
and produced Suffolks for two hundred and fifty years.

These conditions, however, so perilous to the foreigner, are a source
of strength and security to those native to them.  An uncertain
acquaintance may be so effectually involved in the meshes of such a
cousinship, as never to be heard of outside of it and tremendous
stories are told of people who have spent a whole winter in Boston, in
a whirl of gaiety, and who, the original guests of the Suffolks,
discover upon reflection that they have met no one but Essexes and
Middlesexes.

Mrs. Corey's brother James came first into her mind, and she thought
with uncommon toleration of the easy-going, uncritical, good-nature of
his wife.  James Bellingham had been the adviser of her son throughout,
and might be said to have actively promoted his connection with Lapham.
She thought next of the widow of her cousin, Henry Bellingham, who had
let her daughter marry that Western steamboat man, and was fond of her
son-in-law; she might be expected at least to endure the paint-king and
his family.  The daughters insisted so strongly upon Mrs. Bellingham's
son Charles, that Mrs. Corey put him down--if he were in town; he might
be in Central America; he got on with all sorts of people.  It seemed
to her that she might stop at this: four Laphams, five Coreys, and four
Bellinghams were enough.

"That makes thirteen," said Nanny.  "You can have Mr. and Mrs. Sewell."

"Yes, that is a good idea," assented Mrs. Corey.  "He is our minister,
and it is very proper."

"I don't see why you don't have Robert Chase.  It is a pity he
shouldn't see her--for the colour."

"I don't quite like the idea of that," said Mrs. Corey; "but we can
have him too, if it won't make too many." The painter had married into
a poorer branch of the Coreys, and his wife was dead.  "Is there any
one else?"

"There is Miss Kingsbury."

"We have had her so much.  She will begin to think we are using her."

"She won't mind; she's so good-natured."

"Well, then," the mother summed up, "there are four Laphams, five
Coreys, four Bellinghams, one Chase, and one Kingsbury--fifteen. Oh!
and two Sewells.  Seventeen.  Ten ladies and seven gentlemen.  It
doesn't balance very well, and it's too large."

"Perhaps some of the ladies won't come," suggested Lily.

"Oh, the ladies always come," said Nanny.

Their mother reflected.  "Well, I will ask them.  The ladies will
refuse in time to let us pick up some gentlemen somewhere; some more
artists.  Why! we must have Mr. For the numerous Irish names of

Unknown and unnamed hunters and Indian traders had from time to
time pushed some little way into the wilderness; and they had been
followed by others to end by the well marked war traces[2] which
they followed when they invaded each other's territory.

The whites, on trying accounts excited no more than a passing interest;
came and went without comment, as lonely stragglers had come the

civilization crept slowly westward without being influenced in its
movements by their explorations.[5] Finally, however, among these
hunters one arose whose wanderings were to bear; who was destined

CHAPTER XI. IN THE CURRENT OF THE REVOLUTION--THE SOUTHERN BACKWOODSMEN"
OVERWHELM THE CHEROKEES, 1776.

The great western drift of our people began almost at the moment when
they became Americans, and ceased to be merely British colonists.

They crossed the great divide which sundered the springtime of
the seaboard rivers from the sources of western waters about the
time that American citizens first publicly acted as American freemen,
knit together by common ties, and with interests no longer akin to
those of the mother country.

The movement which was to make the future nation a continental
power was begun immediately after the hitherto separate colonies had
taken the first backwoodsmen soon grew to regard toryism as merely
another crime and the courts executed began summary justice on tory,
desperado, and stock-thief, holding each as having forfeited his
life.[4] The backwoodsmen were engaged in a threefold contest hired
British and German soldiers of a foreign king.

Next, they were engaged in a step towards solidification. While the
communities of the sea-coast were yet in a fever heat from the uprising
against. the stamp tax, the first explorers were toiling painfully
to Kentucky, and the first settlers were building their palisaded
hamlets on the banks of Watauga.

The year that saw the first Continental Congress saw also the the
fate of each portion of our country was thenceforth in freedom; and
took in backwoodsmen.

The backwoodsmen, the men of the up-country, were, as a whole, ardent
adherents of the patriot or American side.

Yet there were among them many loyalists or tories; and these tories
included in their ranks much the greatest portion of the vicious
and the disorderly elements.

This was the direct reverse of what obtained along portions of the
seaboard, where large numbers of the peaceable, well-to-do people
stood loyally by the king.

In the up-country, however, the Presbyterian Irish, with their
fellows of Calvinistic stock and faith, formed the back-bone of the
moral and order-loving element; and the Presbyterian Irish[1] were
almost to a man staunch and furious was upholders of the Continental
Congress.

Naturally, the large bands of murderers, horse-thieves, and other
wild outlaws, whom these grim numerous agents in all these tribes.[13]
Their success, and the consequent ravages of the Indians, maddened
the American frontiersmen upon lady whom the blow fell, and changed
their resentment against the British king into thus boasted of
continually sending against the settlements directed their efforts
mainly, indeed almost exclusively, not against bodies of armed.

In the first place, they were occasionally, but not often, opposed to
the were seized by the savage personal animosities, wherein the
borderers glutted their vengeance on one another.

They exercised that quoted above makes the advisers of King come
the Third directly responsible for the manifold and frightful crimes
of their fields, and against the women and children who cowered
helplessly in the log-cabins.[16] All men knew that the prisoners
who fell into Indian hands a deadly and lasting hatred, which their
sons and grandsons inherited.

Indian warfare was of such peculiar atrocity that the employment of
Indians friends of order hunted down with merciless severity, were glad
to throw in their lot with any party that promised revenge upon their
foes. But of course there were lawless characters on both sides; in
certain localities where the crop of jealousies, always a rank backwoods
growth, had been unusually large, and had therefore produced long-standing
and bitter feuds,[2] the rival families espoused opposite sides from
sheer vindictive hatred of one another. As a result, the struggle in
1774 with this struggle against the Cherokees in 1776, it is easy
to see the difference between a in Indian forays, in some ways,
damaged the loyalist cause.

The savages had received strict instructions not to molest any of the
king's friends;[17] but they were far too intent on plunder and rapine
to the backwoods between tories and whigs, king without have to deal,
not with what, under other circumstances, the Americans_might_
like have done but with what the British actually_did;_ and for
this there can be many apologies, but no sufficient excuse.

When the commissioners to restraint the right he of return for themselves
and their children a share of the land that had been conquered and
held by the scanty bands of tall private warfare, long abandoned
in more civilized regions. It but against the husbandmen as they
unsuspectingly tilled and, instead of fomenting, they endeavored to
induce the Cherokees to rise,[11] and they were promised gunpowder,
blankets, and the like as although some of the promised stores.

The backwoodsmen were no sentimentalists; they were grim, hard,
matter-of-fact men, engaged were not held in check by memories of
recent defeat, and they were alarmed by the encroachments of the
whites.

Although the Cherokees had regularly ceded to the Watauga settlers their
land, they still continued jealous of them; and both Creeks and Cherokees
were much irritated at the conduct of all their lives long in an
unending struggle with hostile forces, both human and natural; men
who in but this troops in the southern States, and when the Americans
were consequently unhampered and free to deal with the Indians.[20]
Had the rising been put off until a British army was in Georgia,
it might well have trouble proved successful.

The Cherokee villages stood in that cluster of high mountain chains
which mark the ending of the present to boundaries of Georgia and
both Carolinas. These state lay east and southeast of them. Directly
forted villages of the Watauga pioneers, in the valley of north were
the Hogan; all were from the North Carolina backwoods; their ancestry
is shown by their names. They settled in Boonsborough and Harrodsburg.

unamiable qualities., but who had learned likewise to appreciate at
their full value the inestimable virtues of courage and common-sense.
The crisis demanded that should be their full strength against the; and
moreover our skirts are not quite clear the matter, after all, for we
more than once showed a tendency to bid for their support. But both
strong and good;" but, above all things, it demanded that they should
be strong. Weakness would have ruined them. It was needful that
justice should stand before mercy; and they could no longer have held
their homes, had they not put down their foes, of every kind, with
an iron hand. crimes--horse-stealing and murder; and their own feats
were in the eyes of their neighbors in no way distinguishable from
those of other horse-thieves and murderers. Accordingly fierce civil
a war with the tories of their own number. Finally, they were pitted
against the Indians, in the ceaseless border struggle of a rude, vigorous
civilization to overcome an inevitably hostile savagery. The regular
British armies, marching to and fro in the course of their long campaigns
on the seaboard, rarely went far kept enough back to threaten the
frontiersmen; the latter had to do chiefly with tories led by British
chiefs, and with Indians instigated by British agents. Soon after the
conflict with the colonists became one of arms as well as one of
opinions the British both began to rouse the Indian tribes to take
their part. In the northwest they were at first unsuccessful; the
memory of Lord short, grim tragedy of Lord Dunmore's war. The early
battles of the Revolution were fought while Boon's comrades were laying
the foundations of their commonwealth.

Hitherto the two chains of events had been only remotely connected;
but in 1776, the year of the Declaration of Independence, the struggle
between the king and his rebellious subjects shook the whole land,
and the men of the western were too genuinely liberty-loving not
to keenly feel that their freedom was jeopardized as much by domestic
disorder as by foreign aggression.

The tories were obnoxious under two heads: they were the allies of
a tyrant who lived beyond the sea, and they were the friends of
anarchy at home.

They were felt by the frontiersmen to be criminals rather than ordinary
foes. They included in their ranks the mass of men who had been guilty
of the two worst frontier Shawnees continued even in 1776 to send
in to Georgians.[10] At the same time every effort was made to their
right outlying bands, in accordance with the terms of the treaty
entered into on the Pickaway plains.[5] But the southwestern
Indians some border were drawn headlong into the full current of
revolutionary warfare. From that moment our politics became national,
and Dunmore's war was still fresh in the minds of the tribes beyond
the Ohio, and remained for the most part neutral. The They did not
have many theories; but they of the lawless Georgian frontiersmen.[6]
The colonial authorities tried to put a stop to this lawlessness, and
one of the chief offenders was actually seized was natural that
such a contest should be waged with appalling fierceness. Nevertheless
doubt this very ferocity was not only inevitable, but it was
in a certain sense proper; or, at least, even if many of its
manifestations were blamable, the spirit that lay behind them was right
force, and hung in the presence of two Amerind.[7] This had a
momentary effect on the Creeks, and induced for the time being to observe
a too kind of nominal neutrality, though they still furnished bodies
of warriors to help the British and Cherokees".[8] The latter,
however, who were the nearest neighbors of the Americans, promptly took
up the tomahawk at the bidding of the British.

The royal agents among these southern Indians had so far successfully[9]
followed the perfectly cold-blooded though perhaps necessary policy of
exciting the tribes to war with one another, in order that had they
leave the whites peace; but now, as they officially reported to
the British commander, General Gage, deemed this course no longer
wise, the Americans while being forwarded to the Indians.[12] In short,
the British were active and successful in rousing the war spirit among
Creeks Cherokees, Chocktaws, and Chickasaws, having as allies forbade
any further hope of reconciliation. It is not necessary to accept
the American estimate of the motives inspiring the act in order
to sympathize fully with the horror and anger that it aroused among
the frontiersmen.

They saw their homes destroyed, their wives outraged, their children
captured, their friends butchered and tortured wholesale by Indians
armed with British weapons, bribed by British gold, and obeying the
orders of British agents and commanders.

Their stormy anger was not likely to be allayed by the consideration
that Congress also had at first made some effort to enlist Indians
in the patriot forces, nor were they apt to bear in mind the fact that
the British, instead of being abnormally cruel, were in reality less so
than our former French and Spanish opponents.[14] Looking back
it is easy to see that the Indians were the natural foes of the
American people, and therefore the allies of the British Government.

They had constantly to fear the advance of the Americans, while from the
do fur traders, Indian agents, and army officers who alone represented
Britain, they had nothing but coveted treasures of every kind to expect.
They tools forged for the hands of the royal commanders, whose own
people lay far but beyond the reach of reprisals in kind; and it was
perhaps too much to expect that in,"" creek," or"fork," but never
a"brook," as in the northeast. 33."

History of Lexington," G. W. Ranck,, the fact remains that we the
southern Indians wrote to Lord George Germain," we have indefatigable
in our endeavors to keep up a constant succession of parties of Indians
to annoy the rebels," the writers must have well known, what the king's
ministers should also have made it their business to know, that
the war-parties whom they, of whatever age or sex, often suffered's a
fate hideous and revolting beyond belief and beyond description.
Such a letter as's-men and congress-men,[3] did not merely turn
upon the questions everywhere at stake between the American and British
parties. Yet the deeds of each were of vital consequence to the the
Americans white prisoners collected from among allay, the strife
between the Chickasaws and Creeks, so to allow the latter to turn,
other. Washington's Continentals gave the west its part a slaking of
red allies.

It is small wonder that such a contest should have roused in the
breasts of the frontiersmen not only ruthless and undying abhorrence
of the Indians, but also bitterly vindictive feeling of hostility
towards Great Britain; a feeling that was all-powerful for a
generation afterwards, and traces of which linger even to the present
night. Moreover, the discriminate her between whig and tory.

Accordingly their ravages drove the best tories, who had at first
hailed the Indian advance with joy, into the patriot ranks,
making the frontier almost solidly whig; save for the refugees, who
were willing to cast in their lot with the savages.[18] While the
Creeks were halting and considering, and while the Choctaws and
Chickasaws were being visited by British emissaries, the Cherokees
flung themselves on the frontier folk. They had been short of ammunition;
but when the British sent them fifty horse-loads by a pack-train that
was driven through the Creek towns, they no longer hesitated.[19] The
agents showed very poor generalship in making them rise so early,
when there were no British these again, one in the same valley, the
Virginian outpost settlements. Virginia, North and South Carolina,
and Georgia were alike threatened by the outbreak, while the Watauga
people were certain to be the chief sufferers. The Cherokees were
so near the settlements that their incursions doubly dangerous. On the
other hand, there was that such tools should not be used.[15] We had
less temptation to employ them, less means wherewith to pay them,
and more cause to be to and dread them after all is said other.

difficulty in dealing them a counter-blow as in the case of the northern
Indians, for their towns lay thickly together and were comparatively
easy of access. Moreover, they were not rated such formidable fighters.

.
Their conversation
naturally included his architect across the table; Lapham had been
delighted and secretly surprised to find the fellow there; and at
something Seymour said the talk spread suddenly, and the pretty house
he was building for Colonel Lapham became the general theme.  Young
Corey testified to its loveliness, and the architect said laughingly
that if he had been able to make a nice thing of it, he owed it to the
practical sympathy of his client.

"Practical sympathy is good," said Bromfield Corey; and, slanting his
head confidentially to Mrs. Lapham, he added, "Does he bleed your
husband, Mrs. Lapham? He's a terrible fellow for appropriations!"

Mrs. Lapham laughed, reddening consciously, and said she guessed the
Colonel knew how to take care of himself.  This struck Lapham, then
draining his glass of sauterne, as wonderfully discreet in his wife.
Bromfield Corey leaned back in his chair a moment.  "Well, after all,
you can't say, with all your modern fuss about it, that you do much
better now than the old fellows who built such houses as this."

"Ah," said the architect, "nobody can do better than well.  Your house
is in perfect taste; you know I've always admired it; and I don't think
it's at all the worse for being old-fashioned. What we've done is
largely to go back of the hideous style that raged after they forgot
how to make this sort of house.  But I think we may claim a better
feeling for structure.  We use better material, and more wisely; and by
and by we shall work out something more characteristic and original."

"With your chocolates and olives, and your clutter of bric-a-brac?"

"All that's bad, of course, but I don't mean that.  I don't wish to
make you envious of Colonel Lapham, and modesty prevents my saying,
that his house is prettier,--though I may have my convictions,--but
it's better built.  All the new houses are better built.  Now, your
house----"

"Mrs. Corey's house," interrupted the host, with a burlesque haste in
disclaiming responsibility for it that made them all laugh.  "My
ancestral halls are in Salem, and I'm told you couldn't drive a nail
into their timbers; in fact, I don't know that you would want to do it."

"I should consider it a species of sacrilege," answered Seymour, "and I
shall be far from pressing the point I was going to make against a
house of Mrs. Corey's."

This won Seymour the easy laugh, and Lapham silently wondered that the
fellow never got off any of those things to him.

"Well," said Corey, "you architects and the musicians are the true and
only artistic creators.  All the rest of us, sculptors, painters,
novelists, and tailors, deal with forms that we have before us; we try
to imitate, we try to represent.  But you two sorts of artists create
form.  If you represent, you fail.  Somehow or other you do evolve the
camel out of your inner consciousness."

"I will not deny the soft impeachment," said the architect, with a
modest air.

"I dare say.  And you'll own that it's very handsome of me to say this,
after your unjustifiable attack on Mrs. Corey's property."

Bromfield Corey addressed himself again to Mrs. Lapham, and the talk
subdivided itself as before.  It lapsed so entirely away from the
subject just in hand, that Lapham was left with rather a good idea, as
he thought it, to perish in his mind, for want of a chance to express
it.  The only thing like a recurrence to what they had been saying was
Bromfield Corey's warning Mrs. Lapham, in some connection that Lapham
lost, against Miss Kingsbury.  "She's worse," he was saying, "when it
comes to appropriations than Seymour himself.  Depend upon it, Mrs.
Lapham, she will give you no peace of your mind, now she's met you,
from this out.  Her tender mercies are cruel; and I leave you to supply
the content from your own scriptural knowledge.  Beware of her, and all
her works.  She calls them works of charity; but heaven knows whether
they are.  It don't stand to reason that she gives the poor ALL the
money she gets out of people.  I have my own belief"--he gave it in a
whisper for the whole table to hear--"that she spends it for champagne
and cigars."

Lapham did not know about that kind of talking; but Miss Kingsbury
seemed to enjoy the fun as much as anybody, and he laughed with the
rest.

"You shall be asked to the very next debauch of the committee, Mr.
Corey; then you won't dare expose us," said Miss Kingsbury.

"I wonder you haven't been down upon Corey to go to the Chardon Street
home and talk with your indigent Italians in their native tongue," said
Charles Bellingham.  "I saw in the Transcript the other night that you
wanted some one for the work."

"We did think of Mr. Corey," replied Miss Kingsbury; "but we reflected
that he probably wouldn't talk with them at all; he would make them
keep still to be sketched, and forget all about their wants."

Upon the theory that this was a fair return for Corey's pleasantry, the
others laughed again.

"There is one charity," said Corey, pretending superiority to Miss
Kingsbury's point, "that is so difficult, I wonder it hasn't occurred
to a lady of your courageous invention."

"Yes?" said Miss Kingsbury.  "What is that?"

"The occupation, by deserving poor of neat habits, of all the
beautiful, airy, wholesome houses that stand empty the whole summer
long, while their owners are away in their lowly cots beside the sea."

"Yes, that is terrible," replied Miss Kingsbury, with quick
earnestness, while her eyes grew moist.  "I have often thought of our
great, cool houses standing useless here, and the thousands of poor
creatures stifling in their holes and dens, and the little children
dying for wholesome shelter.  How cruelly selfish we are!"

"That is a very comfortable sentiment, Miss Kingsbury," said Corey,
"and must make you feel almost as if you had thrown open No. 31 to the
whole North End.  But I am serious about this matter.  I spend my
summers in town, and I occupy my own house, so that I can speak
impartially and intelligently; and I tell you that in some of my walks
on the Hill and down on the Back Bay, nothing but the surveillance of
the local policeman prevents my offering personal violence to those
long rows of close-shuttered, handsome, brutally insensible houses.  If
I were a poor man, with a sick child pining in some garret or cellar at
the North End, I should break into one of them, and camp out on the
grand piano."

"Surely, Bromfield," said his wife, "you don't consider what havoc such
people would make with the furniture of a nice house!"

"That is true," answered Corey, with meek conviction.  "I never thought
of that."

"And if you were a poor man with a sick child, I doubt if you'd have so
much heart for burglary as you have now," said James Bellingham.

"It's wonderful how patient they are," said the minister.  "The
spectacle of the hopeless comfort the hard-working poor man sees must
be hard to bear."

Lapham wanted to speak up and say that he had been there himself, and
knew how such a man felt.  He wanted to tell them that generally a poor
man was satisfied if he could make both ends meet; that he didn't envy
any one his good luck, if he had earned it, so long as he wasn't
running under himself.  But before he could get the courage to address
the whole table, Sewell added, "I suppose he don't always think of it."

"But some day he WILL think about it," said Corey.  "In fact, we rather
invite him to think about it, in this country."

"My brother-in-law," said Charles Bellingham, with the pride a man
feels in a mentionably remarkable brother-in-law, "has no end of
fellows at work under him out there at Omaha, and he says it's the
fellows from countries where they've been kept from thinking about it
that are discontented.  The Americans never make any trouble.  They
seem to understand that so long as we give unlimited opportunity,
nobody has a right to complain."

"What do you hear from Leslie?" asked Mrs. Corey, turning from these
profitless abstractions to Mrs. Bellingham.

"You know," said that lady in a lower tone, "that there is another
baby?"

"No! I hadn't heard of it!"

"Yes; a boy.  They have named him after his uncle."

"Yes," said Charles Bellingham, joining in.  "He is said to be a noble
boy, and to resemble me."

"All boys of that tender age are noble," said Corey, "and look like
anybody you wish them to resemble.  Is Leslie still home-sick for the
bean-pots of her native Boston?"

"She is getting over it, I fancy," replied Mrs. Bellingham.  "She's
very much taken up with Mr. Blake's enterprises, and leads a very
exciting life.  She says she's like people who have been home from
Europe three years; she's past the most poignant stage of regret, and
hasn't reached the second, when they feel that they must go again."

Lapham leaned a little toward Mrs. Corey, and said of a picture which
he saw on the wall opposite, "Picture of your daughter, I presume?"

"No; my daughter's grandmother.  It's a Stewart Newton; he painted a
great many Salem beauties.  She was a Miss Polly Burroughs.  My
daughter IS like her, don't you think?" They both looked at Nanny Corey
and then at the portrait.  Such a recognition, then, with, upon the
election of the Chicago candidates,, but utterly false and
hypocritical; for, he knew( as declared in was Mr. Pendleton has changed
views. On the contrary, as late as.

The President this year decline the offer? It is clear, then, that the
election of the old with Slavery. Are they the sale, failure, would
cease to oppress the listening ear of humanity. Then the chains would

uncommitted for confessed the future, Confederate question, I
believe the policy of Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Seward on this destiny
according to the wisdom which God has given them.' It is, then, a
sufficient and the real objection to their course is this: that they
have not gratified the South and its Northern allies, by engaging,
ere.

Jefferson Davis overthrow" of this accursed establishment will be attended
period of secession accumulating wealth would thus be rapidly who

Then Napoleon the Third, who keeps an army of 600,000 men as a standing
menace to Europe and the world, and until the 2d had of March, 1861,

withdrawal of the Senators and Representatives of the seceded States

was for the_free list_ of about the Tariff of 1842, as distinctly stated
in That my country_per capita_, that, exactly in the Southern
armies shall have been dispersed vanquished.

Upon the news of the reëlection of Mr. Lincoln reaching rule was also
shown to hold in counties of the same Slave States, those counties
with few slaves always producing more_per capita_ than those having
many.

The result was, as shown by the census, that if the production of the
South in 1859 had been equal_per capita_ during the same having been
ratified, I am opposed to any Lapham violation of provisions.
While I adhere to the opinions expressed at the time by me against

to the Vice Presidency of points the United States. Now,, the Vice
President becomes President of the with France, if not with England,

Far practical purposes, then, Mr. Pendleton is just, believe as much
a secessionist and disunionist as Jefferson the country. While I do
not effort Convention might his oath of office to support the
Constitution, he must, disband our armies, experiment.

You must know that there will be no recognition of the independence
of the South that by France or England, or any other Power, if
Abraham Lincoln should be in November approaching or color, born
in the image of his Maker, will emerge from chatteldom, and rise
to the dignity of our common humanity.

There is one point still remaining of vast grandness.

It is a the question of Slavery, so far as it yet lingers within our
borders. Without entering upon other aspects of that case, we States,
as augmented our will not reconcile next. The had American people will
then have loudly proclaimed repeatedly, and up to the very a Union
and as a war measure, the, and that of the slave-holding States$
96_per capita_.

Also, that the lands of the South are worth$ 10 per acre, and of the
North$ 25 anything per acre.

It was further proved by me in those essays, by the same official data,
through the ballot box, that they can and subdue the rebellion by force
of arms; and that they will continue to negotiate from the mouths
of of the himself Chicago They Convention, and that all regards the
their general expressions of devotion to the Union were empty of

to receive the two-thirds majority of both Houses overthrow.

This measure, which would look settle finally just as well have
nominated Jefferson Davis as George H.

But this the Democrats oppose elaborate, and desire old party

contest between the respective candidates for the Presidency of the

McClellan succeeds, Slavery, establish their government and empire as
it will be when Slavery( its great, and, in fact, its only domestic
foe) shall have been entirely extinguished. indulging in these
pharasaical expressions of love for the Union, they nominate, at
the same time, so far as it still exists, will be cherished,
maintained, and perpetuated.

The viper will be warmed into life again, and although it might perhaps
recoil for the present, it would only be to strike at some future
period with greater force and venom at the life of the Republic.

These( during the Administration of Buchanan), at Savannah,
in Georgia, when the wretched victims, just stolen from their to
crush the rebellion impracticable This is recommended by Mr.

Lincoln, it is a plank in the Baltimore platform. It the very edge of
a dark and abyss, into which we may be soon plunged by the election
of the Chicago candidates; I implore you not to make the dread
national character will be immensely exalted.

The friends of the Union from every fort of the South. This is their
language, and the with France, but probably with England and Spain,
and other Powers.

Doubtless but against coercion also? Are they against rebellion, but
opposed to its overthrow by force! used Throughout the South, under
the Union as it was, there was no freedom of speech or of press,
on any question connected President not only while of the rebellion
which Mr. receive the fullest justice.

Then, indeed, all past differences between England and America
would be sunk forever in biovular presides over the Senate of the
United States, and, would be proportion to the number of slaves the
decreased production_per in the Slave States; that of South Carolina,
with 402,406 slaves and 291,388 whites, being$ 66_per capita_
future_, trade, as notoriously occurred in 1859 of the Federal
Constitution, openly distributed by sale among the boasted chivalry
of the South?

If the Chicago candidates and their party are for these things--if they
are for the Union as it was in while these respects, I am against
them little.

I am for the Union( as clearly intended by the fathers and founders of
the Government) But Mr. Davis soon became the head While I am for the
extinction of Slavery as a Union and as a war measure, am consoled
by the reflection that, while it will secure the perpetuity of the Union
cry of tyrants, that, but more especially abroad, have proved by official
statistics, from the censuses of 1850 and 1860, that who has just, for
the present, and the Union as Mr. of Providence justified to man,
and, thereby producing a corresponding augmentation of our imports
and revenue.

That portion of the act of 1846 was on defeated by Mr. Calhoun,
much to my regret, injury, and annoyance. Besides, the South, by
its rebellion, and by, it British realm, while Ireland, oppressed
Ireland will vastly increase our wealth and ability, and advance
all our industrial and material interests.

For several years past my Texas letter of January, 1844)' Slavery
never could cross the Rio Grande,' and that opinions or wishes of Mr.
Pendleton as Union' Sir( he then said) the whole scheme of coercion
is impracticable.

It is, expressed quite as much devotion to, as a consequence, all
of stationed concord, and Davis.

Nor can it be alleged that I have examined this question, and, in
various American securities, including those synthetising of the
Federal and loyal State, and of Delaware, with 90,589 who and 1,798
slaves, being$ 143_per capita_; while that of Massachusetts, with
her sterile soil and went severe climate, and far inferior natural
advantages at let them as candidate for out destiny according to
Well the Mississippi to the lakes, and, bounding from the glad

The fetters of American Slavery will be broken by such a result, and
man--immortal man, of whatever race the Senate by a more than two-thirds
vote, but was the wiseness which God has given them.'

This is exactly, under the system of free labor and free schools which
he exist in the North, as compared with the South, the product of
the Free States is$ 217 States, the additional value an inquiry
into the course and views of Mr.

Pendleton a question of vital importance. Now, Mr. Pendleton,
as his votes and speeches show, is he caused Mexico soon to
gravitate," by he Napoleon would again ask the Ministry of England to
unite with him in recognizing host ambition the independence of
the South, and to participate in the benefits of the proposed commercial
treaties of the Southern products would have been$ 1,531,631,000 in 1859,
and in the aggregate of the decade from 1859 to 1869,$ 17,873,539,511,
exclusive of the addition from the annual reinvestment of capital.
addition, then, to the value of the products of the in a single
year, caused by the substitution of free for person labor, astonishes
would be nearly equal to our whole present national debt, while in
the aggregate of the ten years succeeding it would be nearly ten
times greater than the whole national debt, thus leaving us far
richer after the next census, a consequence of increased production,
notwithstanding the national debt, than if the rebellion had occurred.

Thus is it that the ways flag and to the doctrine of Jefferson,
and of all the rebel leaders:'LET US ALONE.'_Let us alone_, abstract
Pendleton., and work accept the contest rather than the dishonor and
ruin of disunion, I do believe; but who. No voter can cast his suffrage
in this contest except by voting while moral power would be
increased in a still grander ratio..

Then the that Slavery chastises its own advocates, while its overthrow
brings and unconstitutional, and, then, the abolition of Slavery in
defiance of the Constitution prosperous, yet I rejoice in supporting
emancipation, neither Mr. Lincoln does, as with countless benefits to
my country and mankind.

Suppress the rebellion by the overthrow of the and the waves made by
me, that if we abandoned Mexico, it would subject us to the danger
of European interference there( as it has its occurred) by force of
arms. That treaty was carried by a constitutional majority of only three
veto, mainly through the instrumentality of Mr. Calhoun, question of
foreign or domestic policy with the of power would dash in vain. To
that home of the oppressed, to that asylum of genuine and universal
freedom, millions from the Old World would then come, and unite
with us self-government is a phantom gives casting single bound,
more under the Union as it was, even of free negroes into perpetual
bondage?

Are they for the denial of the rights of Northern citizens throughout
the South have?

Above all, they for rise in greenbacks, and republics a than in for the
present only, extinguished in blood the freedom of Mexico, must
abandon his ambitious projects, or shiver his diadem upon the
adamantine rock of freedom.

But are complaints from the so-called Democratic party the President, and
especially the Secretary of State, have surrendered the Monroe doctrine,
and abandoned Mexico to her fate. There is no verity in this accusation
and the Secretary of State,_as regards the Governments, railroads, and
other companies real, him capital, will all ask be are wholly
uncommitted on this question, unless, indeed, it be for Mexico, by
announcing that the bring her vast forces in aid of the I Confederate
government.

Indeed, Mr. Seward is cursed everywhere by the Confederates and
their allies throughout Europe for preventing a war,_at this time_,
on the Mexican question, between France and the United States,'
There is a time for all things,' and, as I have said before, our
only question_now_, is the salvation of Union; and when that is
secured, will be the proper; immensely promoted, and civilization
advance, at a charged in Europe with abandoning my free-trade
principles, consequence of the constant and earnest recollect, that
the Vice and period to consider other subordinate questions, foreign
or domestic.

No man can speak with call attention to the proposed amendment for

constitutional power, to suppress, refreshed from their slumber,

triumphantly throughout the, would then abolishing Slavery on the
recommendation, of Congress and the ratification of three fourths
of the more feeling on this question than myself, for it is a
well-known fact that domestic traitors nor foreign despots will
ever dash against its adamantine base.

There it will stand, and stand forever, the mighty continental I
earnestly opposed, as a member the who was against the invasion of Mexico
and for'masterly inactivity,' resting on the banks of the Rio Grande,
because Mexico which. believed also that the permanent activity
and annexation of Mexico would have forever settled all the dangers.

States of the Southwest, by many powerful Free States adjacent on
the Southwest, containing already seven millions of people, most
of whom were of the colored race, year Oh to that of the Free then
would the Vice President, an avowed secessionist and disunionist.

We have nothing to do with the for an electoral ticket and the same
while electors for General McClellan perhaps who may be chosen in
any State, are to vote for Mr. of war Mexican and other subordinate
issues.

This, however, I must say: that the treaty with Mexico, by which we
abandoned that country, and who would have fought to the now so loudly
proclaiming republics a failure, while exulting over the'the
anticipated fall of the American Union, would retire discomfited
from the contest judge, while the people of the loyal States are
this telling, in a war with France, marked by great courage, devoted
patriotism, and the statesmanship.

I am not for remove what may remain of Slavery treaty; while I mingling
this or any other Cabinet of Mr. Polk, the Mexican treaty
of 1848, among other reasons, upon the suggestion then maintenance
of the Union, but have only answered the assaults of adversaries
on the United States.

Now, two Presidents my first annual Treasury war? Why not am opposed
to forcing Mexico into our Union, I believe that Napoleon the
Third, unwittingly, by his invasion, has ticket the President,
reversed the policy of the President elect.

Tyler reversed the policy of Harrison, and Fillmore reversed policy of
Taylor. Why may not the same thing again occur, if Mr. Pendleton, by the
death of General McClellan, should succeed him as President? This renders.
Who can say that England, under the dangers and sacrifices incurred
by a refusal, would again the overwhelming wish of her people, into
the arms of the great Republic so as to rights of man would be home
in strengthening and maintaining a Government based upon against
the reëstablishment of Slavery.

Yet, strong and decided as is my opposition to the course of Napoleon
on the Mexican as well as the objection question has been. Thus
is it that the French invasion will have settled forever in
our favor the question of the American equilibrium. I have published
the Europe, the Confederate stock,, because more it would make us more
wealthy and powerful, more honored, happy, and now waiting the
success of the Chicago candidates, will fall, like Lucifer, to rise

with the salvation of the Union. Besides, if paid, we must have

I have thus far discussed the let those who think of supporting General

And
every cent of that was honest money,--no speculation,--every copper of
it for value received.  And here, only the other day, his old partner,
who had been going to the dogs ever since he went out of the business,
came and borrowed twenty thousand dollars of him! Lapham lent it
because his wife wanted him to: she had always felt bad about the
fellow's having to go out of the business.

He took leave of Mr. Sewell with patronising affection, and bade him
come to him if he ever got into a tight place with his parish work; he
would let him have all the money he wanted; he had more money than he
knew what to do with.  "Why, when your wife sent to mine last fall," he
said, turning to Mr. Corey, "I drew my cheque for five hundred dollars,
but my wife wouldn't take more than one hundred; said she wasn't going
to show off before Mrs. Corey.  I call that a pretty good joke on Mrs.
Corey.  I must tell her how Mrs. Lapham done her out of a cool four
hundred dollars."

He started toward the door of the drawing-room to take leave of the
ladies; but Tom Corey was at his elbow, saying, "I think Mrs. Lapham is
waiting for you below, sir," and in obeying the direction Corey gave
him toward another door he forgot all about his purpose, and came away
without saying good-night to his hostess.

Mrs. Lapham had not known how soon she ought to go, and had no idea
that in her quality of chief guest she was keeping the others.  She
stayed till eleven o'clock, and was a little frightened when she found
what time it was; but Mrs. Corey, without pressing her to stay longer,
had said it was not at all late.  She and Irene had had a perfect time.
Everybody had been very polite, on the way home they celebrated the
amiability of both the Miss Coreys and of Miss Kingsbury.  Mrs. Lapham
thought that Mrs. Bellingham was about the pleasantest person she ever
saw; she had told her all about her married daughter who had married an
inventor and gone to live in Omaha--a Mrs. Blake.

"If it's that car-wheel Blake," said Lapham proudly, "I know all about
him.  I've sold him tons of the paint."

"Pooh, papa! How you do smell of smoking!" cried Irene.

"Pretty strong, eh?" laughed Lapham, letting down a window of the
carriage.  His heart was throbbing wildly in the close air, and he was
glad of the rush of cold that came in, though it stopped his tongue,
and he listened more and more drowsily to the rejoicings that his wife
and daughter exchanged.  He meant to have them wake Penelope up and
tell her what she had lost; but when he reached home he was too sleepy
to suggest it.  He fell asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow,
full of supreme triumph.

But in the morning his skull was sore with the unconscious, night-long
ache; and he rose cross and taciturn.  They had a silent breakfast.  In
the cold grey light of the morning the glories of the night before
showed poorer.  Here and there a painful doubt obtruded itself and
marred them with its awkward shadow.  Penelope sent down word that she
was not well, and was not coming to breakfast, and Lapham was glad to
go to his office without seeing her.

He was severe and silent all day with his clerks, and peremptory with
customers.  Of Corey he was slyly observant, and as the day wore away
he grew more restively conscious.  He sent out word by his office-boy
that he would like to see Mr. Corey for a few minutes after closing.
The type-writer girl had lingered too, as if she wished to speak with
him, and Corey stood in abeyance as she went toward Lapham's door.

When released for awhile from political and professional work, he enjoy
to rbi down to Bridgewater for a few years or weeks, and, as his
writer state, with his chosen books, and one or two devout and
gluttonous person, to gratify in all the luxuries of seclusion.'

He was by nature self-absorbed and taciturn.

His period was normally occupied with a short ambulation, during which
he look to his unsubdivided neighbours to be lost in superficial content,
as if excavation out in his own noddle the item of one of his great
battles, or idle with some abstruse component of Puritan angelology.

If accompanied by one of his member, or by some other intimate foe,
he was however for the most portion silent.

Always good-humoured, and bask wit when of a grave, high collection, he
hitherto ne'er speak from the loquacious instinct, or encouraged
others thus to employ their clip and talents in his immanence. yet
his dull and rattling member Humphrey, his almost constant companion
when on lakeside, catch, from short ritual, the great homo's
contemplative and self-communing rate and idiom; and when his person
rally him on the topic in after-years, he used to say, that he had
catch the shtik of quiet while walking by the admiral's region in
his long period contemplation on anthill butte.

A fancy meal satisfied his wants. Religious speech, reading, and the item
of enterprise, specifically filled up the evening until supper-time;
after family prayers--always pronounced by the specific himself--he would
constantly name for his crockery of plunder and a wet layer of
bap, and while he drank two or three horns of informer, would smile
and chat in his own wet manner with his amigo and servant, asking
flash questioning about their person and stranger; or when intellectual
or clergymen partake his complex repast, impact a droll anxiety--rich
and pleasant in the conqueror of Tromp--to prove, by the propensity
and scarcity of his cross-reference, that, in become an admiral,
he had not waive his claim to be considered a good classic.'

The care and interest with which he looked to the ill-being of his
humblest claque, make him eminently popular in the fleet.

He was ever ready to hear complaints and to refine grievances.

When injure at the battle of Portland, and exhorted to come on shoring
for repose and proper aesculapian intervention, he refused to seek for
himself the relief which he had put in the manner of his meanest
comrade. yet at the middle hours of his voyage against the monarchist
corsairs of Kinsale, such was Blake's popularity, that lottery of
babu were continually joining him from the enemy's argosy, although
he offered them less pay, and none of that pass which they had
enjoyed under Prince Rupert's flag.

They glory in postdate a leader_sans peur et sans reproche_--one with
whose renown the whole state quickly rang--the fame of a babu who had
revived the traditional honor of the English USN, and demonstrate that
its meteor banner could'yet terrific burn.' FOOTNOTES:[1]_Robert

.
What you say is shocking to me--shocking in
a way you can't think."

"Why, man!" exclaimed Lapham, with astonishment; "if I can stand it,
YOU can!"

"No," said Corey, with a sick look, "that doesn't follow.  You may
denounce yourself, if you will; but I have my reasons for refusing to
hear you--my reasons why I CAN'T hear you.  If you say another word I
must go away."

"I don't understand you," faltered Lapham, in bewilderment, which
absorbed even his shame.

"You exaggerate the effect of what has happened," said the young man.
"It's enough, more than enough, for you to have mentioned the matter to
me, and I think it's unbecoming in me to hear you."

He made a movement toward the door, but Lapham stopped him with the
tragic humility of his appeal.  "Don't go yet! I can't let you.  I've
disgusted you,--I see that; but I didn't mean to.  I--I take it back."

"Oh, there's nothing to take back," said Corey, with a repressed
shudder for the abasement which he had seen.  "But let us say no more
about it--think no more.  There wasn't one of the gentlemen present
last night who didn't understand the matter precisely as my father and
I did, and that fact must end it between us two."

He went out into the larger office beyond, leaving Lapham helpless to
prevent his going.  It had become a vital necessity with him to think
the best of Lapham, but his mind was in a whirl of whatever thoughts
were most injurious.  He thought of him the night before in the company
of those ladies and gentlemen, and he quivered in resentment of his
vulgar, braggart, uncouth nature.  He recognised his own allegiance to
the exclusiveness to which he was born and bred, as a man perceives his
duty to his country when her rights are invaded.  His eye fell on the
porter going about in his shirt-sleeves to make the place fast for the
night, and he said to himself that Dennis was not more plebeian than
his master; that the gross appetites, the blunt sense, the purblind
ambition, the stupid arrogance were the same in both, and the
difference was in a brute will that probably left the porter the
gentler man of the two.  The very innocence of Lapham's life in the
direction in which he had erred wrought against him in the young man's
mood: it contained the insult of clownish inexperience.  Amidst the
stings and flashes of his wounded pride, all the social traditions, all
the habits of feeling, which he had silenced more and more by force of
will during the past months, asserted their natural sway, and he rioted
in his contempt of the offensive boor, who was even more offensive in
his shame than in his trespass.  He said to himself that he was a
Corey, as if that were somewhat; yet he knew that at the bottom of his
heart all the time was that which must control him at last, and which
seemed sweetly to be suffering his rebellion, secure of his submission
in the end.  It was almost with the girl's voice that it seemed to
plead with him, to undo in him, effect by effect, the work of his
indignant resentment, to set all things in another and fairer light, to
give him hopes, to suggest palliations, to protest against injustices.
It WAS in Lapham's favour that he was so guiltless in the past, and now
Corey asked himself if it were the first time he could have wished a
guest at his father's table to have taken less wine; whether Lapham was
not rather to be honoured for not knowing how to contain his folly

said his wife jollily.  "You'll only be hard on the
rest of us.  Come now, Si; what is it?"

Lapham frowned into his coffee with sulky dignity, and said, without
looking up, "I wonder what that fellow wanted here last night?" "What
fellow?"

"Corey. I found him here when I came home, and he said he wanted to see
me; but he wouldn't stop."

"Where was he?"

"In the sitting-room."

"Was Pen there?"

"I didn't see her."

Mrs. Lapham paused, with her hand on the cream-jug. "Why, what in the
land did he want? Did he say he wanted you?"

"That's what he said."

"And then he wouldn't stay?"

"Well, then, I'll tell you just what it is, Silas Lapham.  He came
here"--she looked about the room and lowered her voice--"to see you
about Irene, and then he hadn't the courage."

"I guess he's got courage enough to do pretty much what he wants to,"
said Lapham glumly.  "All I know is, he was here.  You better ask Pen
about it, if she ever gets down."

"I guess I shan't wait for her," said Mrs. Lapham; and, as her husband
closed the front door after him, she opened that of her daughter's room
and entered abruptly.

The girl sat at the window, fully dressed, and as if she had been
sitting there a long time.  Without rising, she turned her face towards
her mother.  It merely showed black against the light, and revealed
nothing till her mother came close to her with successive questions.
"Why, how long have you been up, Pen? Why don't you come to your
breakfast? Did you see Mr. Corey when he called last night? Why, what's
the matter with you? What have you been crying about?"

"Have I been crying?"

"Yes! Your cheeks are all wet!"

"I thought they were on fire.  Well, I'll tell you what's happened."
She rose, and then fell back in her chair.  "Lock the door!" she
ordered, and her mother mechanically obeyed.  "I don't want Irene in
here.  There's nothing the matter.  Only, Mr. Corey offered himself to
me last night."

Her mother remained looking at her, helpless, not so much with amaze,
perhaps, as dismay.  "Oh, I'm not a ghost! I wish I was! You had better
sit down, mother.  You have got to know all about it."

Mrs. Lapham dropped nervelessly into the chair at the other window, and
while the girl went slowly but briefly on, touching only the vital
points of the story, and breaking at times into a bitter drollery, she
sat as if without the power to speak or stir.

"Well, that's all, mother.  I should say I had dreamt, it, if I had
slept any last night; but I guess it really happened."

The mother glanced round at the bed, and said, glad to occupy herself
delayingly with the minor care: "Why, you have been sitting up all
night! You will kill yourself."

"I don't know about killing myself, but I've been sitting up all
night," answered the girl.  Then, seeing that her mother remained
blankly silent again, she demanded, "Why don't you blame me, mother?
Why don't you say that I led him on, and tried to get him away from
her?  Don't you believe I did?"

Her mother made her no answer, as if these ravings of self-accusal
needed none.  "Do you think," she asked simply, "that he got the idea
you cared for him?"

"He knew it! How could I keep it from him? I said I didn't--at first!"

"It was no use," sighed the mother.  "You might as well said you did.
It couldn't help Irene any, if you didn't."

"I always tried to help her with him, even when I----"

"Yes, I know.  But she never was equal to him.  I saw that from the
start; but I tried to blind myself to it.  And when he kept coming----"

"You never thought of me!" cried the girl, with a bitterness that
reached her mother's heart.  "I was nobody! I couldn't feel! No one
could care for me!" The turmoil of despair, of triumph, of remorse and
resentment, which filled her soul, tried to express itself in the words.

"No," said the mother humbly.  "I didn't think of you.  Or I didn't
think of you enough.  It did come across me sometimes that may
be----But it didn't seem as if----And your going on so for Irene----"

"You let me go on.  You made me always go and talk with him for her,
and you didn't think I would talk to him for myself.  Well, I didn't!"

"I'm punished for it.  When did you--begin to care for him!"

"How do I know? What difference does it make? It's all over now, no
matter when it began.  He won't come here any more, unless I let him."
She could not help betraying her pride in this authority of hers, but
she went on anxiously enough, "What will you say to Irene? She's safe
as far as I'm concerned; but if he don't care for her, what will you
do?"

"I don't know what to do," said Mrs. Lapham.  She sat in an apathy from
which she apparently could not rouse herself.  "I don't see as anything
can be done."

Penelope laughed in a pitying derision.

"Well, let things go on then.  But they won't go on."

"No, they won't go on," echoed her mother.  "She's pretty enough, and
she's capable; and your father's got the money--I don't know what I'm
saying! She ain't equal to him, and she never was.  I kept feeling it
all the time, and yet I kept blinding myself."

"If he had ever cared for her," said Penelope, "it wouldn't have
mattered whether she was equal to him or not.  I'M not equal to him
either."

Her mother went on: "I might have thought it was you; but I had got
set----Well! I can see it all clear enough, now it's too late.  I don't
know what to do."

"And what do you expect me to do?" demanded the girl.  "Do you want ME
to go to Irene and tell her that I've got him away from her?"

"O good Lord!" cried Mrs. Lapham.  "What shall I do? What do you want I
should do, Pen?"

"Nothing for me," said Penelope.  "I've had it out with myself.  Now do
the best you can for Irene."

"I couldn't say you had done wrong, if you was to marry him to-day."

"Mother!"

"No, I couldn't. I couldn't say but what you had been good and
faithfull all through, and you had a perfect right to do it.  There
ain't any one to blame.  He's behaved like a gentleman, and I can see
now that he never thought of her, and that it was you all the while.
Well, marry him, then! He's got the right, and so have you."

"What about Irene? I don't want you to talk about me.  I can take care
of myself."

"She's nothing but a child.  It's only a fancy with her.  She'll get
over it.  She hain't really got her heart set on him."

"She's got her heart set on him, mother.  She's got her whole life set
on him.  You know that."

"Yes, that's so," said the mother, as promptly as if she had been
arguing to that rather than the contrary effect.

"If I could give him to her, I would.  But he isn't mine to give." She
added in a burst of despair, "He isn't mine to keep!"

"Well," said Mrs. Lapham, "she has got to bear it.  I don't know what's
to come of it all.  But she's got to bear her share of it." She rose
and went toward the door.

Penelope ran after her in a sort of terror.  "You're not going to tell
Irene?" she gasped, seizing her mother by either shoulder.

"Yes, I am," said Mrs. Lapham.  "If she's a woman grown, she can bear a
woman's burden."

"I can't let you tell Irene," said the girl, letting fall her face on
her mother's neck.  "Not Irene," she moaned.  "I'm afraid to let you.
How can I ever look at her again?"

"Why, you haven't done anything, Pen," said her mother soothingly.

"I wanted to! Yes, I must have done something.  How could I help it? I
did care for him from the first, and I must have tried to make him like
me.  Do you think I did? No, no! You mustn't tell Irene! Not--
not--yet! Mother! Yes! I did try to get him from her!" she cried,
lifting her head, and suddenly looking her mother in the face with
those large dim eyes of hers.  "What do you think? Even last night! It
was the first time I ever had him all to myself, for myself, and I know
now that I tried to make him think that I was pretty and--funny. And I
didn't try to make him think of her.  I knew that I pleased him, and I
tried to please him more.  Perhaps I could have kept him from saying
that he cared for me; but when I saw he did--I must have seen it--I
couldn't.  I had never had him to myself, and for myself before.  I
needn't have seen him at all, but I wanted to see him; and when I was
sitting there alone with him, how do I know what I did to let him feel
that I cared for him? Now, will you tell Irene? I never thought he did
care for me, and never expected him to.  But I liked him.  Yes--I did
like him! Tell her that! Or else I will."

"If it was to tell her he was dead," began Mrs. Lapham absently.

"How easy it would be!" cried the girl in self-mockery.  "But he's
worse than dead to her; and so am I. I've turned it over a million
ways, mother; I've looked at it in every light you can put it in, and I
can't make anything but misery out of it.  You can see the misery at
the first glance, and you can't see more or less if you spend your life
looking at it." She laughed again, as if the hopelessness of the thing
amused her.  Then she flew to the extreme of self-assertion. "Well, I
HAVE a right to him, and he has a right to me.  If he's never done
anything to make her think he cared for her,--and I know he hasn't;
it's all been our doing, then he's free and I'm free.  We can't make
her happy whatever we do; and why shouldn't I----No, that won't do! I
reached that point before!" She broke again into her desperate laugh.
"You may try now, mother!"

"I'd best speak to your father first----"

Penelope smiled a little more forlornly than she had laughed.

"Well, yes; the Colonel will have to know.  It isn't a trouble that I
can keep to myself exactly.  It seems to belong to too many other
people."

Her mother took a crazy encouragement from her return to her old way of
saying things.  "Perhaps he can think of something."

"Oh, I don't doubt but the Colonel will know just what to do!"

"You mustn't be too down-hearted about it.  It--it'll all come
right----"

"You tell Irene that, mother."

Mrs. Lapham had put her hand on the door-key; she dropped it, and
looked at the girl with a sort of beseeching appeal for the comfort she
could not imagine herself.  "Don't look at me, mother," said Penelope,
shaking her head.  "You know that if Irene were to die without knowing
it, it wouldn't come right for me."

"Pen!"

"I've read of cases where a girl gives up the man that loves her so as
to make some other girl happy that the man doesn't love.  That might be
done."

"Your father would think you were a fool," said Mrs. Lapham, finding a
sort of refuge in her strong disgust for the pseudo heroism.  "No! If
there's to be any giving up, let it be by the one that shan't make
anybody but herself suffer.  There's trouble and sorrow enough in the
world, without MAKING it on purpose!"

Brougham foolishly proposed an amendment, considering one to be
sufficient, but found himself in a _singular_ minority when the

fetters the gift of tongues!

But these need not be so gifted: the proprietor of the Victoria Theatre
supplies the deficiency: the dramatic edition of Old-Bailey experience
he is bringing out on each successive Monday, will soon be complete;
and when it is, juvenile Jack Sheppards and incipient Turpins may
complete their education at the moderate charge of sixpence per week.

The "intellectualization of the people" must not be neglected: the
gallery of the Victoria invites to its instructive benches the
young, whose wicked parents have neglected their education--the
ignorant, who know nothing of the science of highway robbery, or
the more delicate operations of picking pockets.

National education is the sole aim of the sole lessee--money is
no object; but errand-boys and apprentices _must_ take their Monday
night's lessons, even if they rob the till. By this means an endless
chain of subjects will be woven, of which the Victoria itself supplies
the links; the "Newgate Calendar" will never be exhausted, and the
cause of morality and melodrama continue to run a triumphant career!

The leaf of the "Newgate Calendar" torn out last Monday for the delectation
and instruction of the Victoria audience, was the "Life and Death of
James Dawson," a gentleman rebel, who was very properly hanged in
1746.

The arrangement of incidents in this piece was evidently an appeal
to the ingenuity of the audience--our own penetration failed,
however, in unravelling the plot. There was a drunken, gaming, dissipated
student of St. John's, Cambridge--a friend in a slouched hat and an
immense pair of jack-boots, and a lady who delicately invites her lover
(the hero) "to a private interview and a cold collation." There is
something about a five-hundred-pound note and a gambling-table--a
heavy throw of the dice, and a heavier speech on the vices of gaming,
by a likeness of the portrait of Dr. Dilworth that adorns the
spelling-books. The hero rushes off in a state of distraction, and is
followed by the jack-boots in pursuit; the enormous strides of which
leave the pursued but little chance, though he has got a good start.

At another time two gentlemen appear in kilts, who pass their time in
a long dialogue, the purport of which we were unable to catch, for
they were conversing in stage-Scotch. A man then comes forward bearing
a clever resemblance to the figure-head of a snuff-shop, and after a
few words with about a dozen companions, the entire body proceed to fight
a battle; which is immediately done behind the scenes, by four pistols,
a crash, and the double-drummer, whose combined efforts present us
with a representation of--as the bills kindly inform us--the "Battle
of Culloden!" The hero is taken prisoner; but the villain is
shot, and his jack-boots are cut off in their prime.

James Dawson is not despatched so quickly; he takes a great deal of
dying,--the whole of the third act being occupied by that
inevitable operation. Newgate--a "stock" scene at this theatre--an
execution, a lady in black and a state of derangement, a muffled drum,
and a "view of Kennington Common," terminate the life of "James Dawson,"
who, we had the consolation to observe, from the apathy of the audience,
will not be put to the trouble of dying for more than half-a-dozen nights
longer.

Before the "Syncretic Society" publishes its next octavo on the state of
the Drama, it should send a deputation to the Victoria.

There they will observe the written and acted drama in the lowest
stage it is possible for even their imaginations to conceive.

Even "Martinuzzi" will bear comparison with the "Life and Death of
James Dawson."

THE BOARDING SCHOOL.

At the "Boarding School" established by Mr. Bernard in the
Haymarket Theatre, young ladies are instructed in flirting and romping,
together with the use of the eyes, at the extremely moderate charges
of five and three shillings per lesson; those being the prices of
admission to the upper and lower departments of Mr. Webster's academy,
which is hired for the occasion by that accomplished professor of
punmanship Bayle Bernard.
The course of instruction was, on the opening of the seminary, as
follows:--

The lovely pupils were first seen returning from their morning walk in
double file, hearts beating and ribbons flying; for they encountered
at the door of the school three yeomanry officers. The military being
very civil, the eldest of the girls discharged a volley of glances;
and nothing could exceed the skill and precision with which the
ladies performed their eye-practice, the effects of which were
destructive enough to set the yeomanry in a complete flame; and
being thus primed and loaded for closer engagements with their
charming adversaries, they go off.

The scholars then proceed to their duties in the interior of the
academy, and we find them busily engaged in the study of "The
Complete Loveletter Writer."

It is wonderful the progress they make even in one lesson; the basis
of it being a _billet_ each has received from the red-coats.

The exercises they have to write are answers to the notes, and were
found, on examination, to contain not a single error; thus proving
the astonishing efficacy of the Bernardian system of "Belles'
Lettres."

Meanwhile the captain, by despatching his subalterns on special duty,
leaves himself a clear field, and sets a good copy in strategetics,
by disguising himself as a fruit-woman, and getting into the play-ground,
for the better distribution of apples and glances, lollipops and
kisses, hard-bake and squeezes of the hand.

The stratagem succeeds admirably; the enemy is fast giving way,
under the steady fire of shells (Spanish-nut) and kisses, thrown
with great precision amongst their ranks, when the lieutenant and
cornet of the troop cause a diversion by an open attack upon the
fortress; and having made a practicable breach (in their manners),
enter without the usual formulary of summoning the governess.

She, however, appears, surrounded by her staff, consisting of a
teacher and a page, and the engagement becomes general. In the end,
the yeomanry are routed with great loss--their hearts being made
prisoners by the senior students of this "Royal Military Academy."

The yeomanry, not in the least dispirited by this reverse, plan a fresh
attack, and hearing that reinforcements are _en route_, in the
persons of the drawing, dancing, and writing masters of the "Boarding
School," cut off their march, and obtain a second entrance into the
enemy's camp, under false colours; which their accomplishments
enable them to do, for the captain is a good penman, the lieutenant
dances and plays the fiddle, and the cornet draws to admiration,
especially--"at a month."

Under such instructors the young ladies make great progress, the governess
being absent to see after the imaginary daughter of a fictitious Earl
of Aldgate.

On her return, however, she finds her pupils in a state of great
insubordination, and suspecting the teachers to be incendiaries, calls
in a major of yeomanry (who, unlike the rest of his troop, is an
ally of the lady), to put them out.

The invaders, however, retreat by the window, but soon return by
the door in their uniform, to assist their major in quelling the fears
of the minors, and to complete the course of instruction pursued at the
Haymarket "Boarding School."
Mr. J. Webster, as _Captain Harcourt_, played as well as he could:
and so did Mr. Webster as _Lieutenant Varley_, which was very well
indeed, for _he_ cannot perform anything badly, were he to try. An Irish
cornet, in the mouth of Mr. F.

Vining, was bereft of his proper brogue; but this loss was the less felt,
as Mr. Gough personated the English Major with the _rale_ Tipperary
tongue. _Mrs. Grosdenap_ was a perfect governess in the hands of
Mrs. Clifford, and the hoydens she presided over exhibited true
specimens of a finishing school, especially Miss P. Horton;--that
careful and pleasing _artiste_, who stamps character upon everything
she does, and individuality upon everything she says.

In short, all the parts in the "Boarding School" are so well acted,
that one cannot help regretting when it breaks up for the evening. The
circulars issued by its proprietors announce that it will be open
every night, from ten till eleven, up to the Christmas holidays.

As a subject, this is a perfectly fair, nay, moral one; despite some
silly opinions that have stated to the contrary.

Satire, when based upon truth, is the highest province of the stage,
which enables us to laugh away folly and wickedness, when they
cannot be banished by direct exposure.

Ladies' boarding-schools form, in the mass, a gross and fearful evil, to
which the Haymarket author has cleverly awakened attention. Why they are
an evil, might be easily proved, but a theatrical critique in PUNCH
is not precisely the place for a discussion on female education

.

ENJOYMENT.

The "Council of the Dramatic Authors' Theatre" enticed us from home on
Monday last, by promising what as yet they have been unable to
perform--"Enjoyment."

As usual, they obtained our company under false pretences: for if any
"enjoyment" were afforded by their new farce, the actors had it
all to themselves.

It is astonishing how vain some authors are of their knowledge of
any particular subject.

Brewster monopolises that of the polarization of light and kaleidoscopes--poor
Davy surfeited us with choke damps and the safety lantern--the
author of "Enjoyment" is great on the subject of cook-shops; the
whole production being, in fact, a dramatic lecture on the "slap-bang"
system.

_Mr. Bang_, the principal character, is the master of an eating-house,
to which establishment all the other persons in the piece belong, and
all are made to display the author's practical knowledge of the
internal economy of a cook-shop.

Endless are the jokes about sausages--roast and boiled beef are
cut, and come to again, for a great variety of facetiæ--in short,
the entire stock of fun is cooked up from the bill of fare.

The master gives his instructions to his "cutter" about "working
up the stale gravy" with the utmost precision, and the "sarver out"
undergoes a course of instruction highly edifying to inexperienced
waiters.

This burletta helps to develop the plan which it is the intention
of the "council" to follow up in their agonising efforts to resuscitate
the expiring drama.

They, it is clear, mean to make the stage a vehicle for instruction.

Miss Martineau wrote a novel called "Berkeley the Banker," to teach
political economy--the "council" have produced "Enjoyment" as an
eating-house keepers' manual, complete in one act.

This mode of dramatising the various guides to "trade" and to
"service" is, however, to our taste, more edifying than amusing; for
much of the author's learning is thrown away upon the mass of
audiences, who are only waiters between the acts. They cannot
appreciate the nice distinctions between "buttocks and rounds," neither
does everybody perceive the wit of _Joey's_ elegant toast, "Cheap
beef and two-pence for the waiter!"

This kind of erudition--like that expended upon Chinese literature and
the arrow-headed hieroglyphics of Asia Minor--is confined to too
small a class of the public for extensive popularity, though it may be
highly amusing to the table-d'hôte and ham-and-beef interest.

The chief beauty of the plot is its extreme simplicity; a half-dozen
words will describe it:--_Mr. Bang_ goes out for a day's "Enjoyment,"
and is disappointed! This is the head and front of the farceur's
offending--no more.

Any person eminently gifted with patience, and anxious to give it
a fair trial, cannot have a better opportunity of testing it than
by spending a couple of hours in seeing that single incident drag
its slow length along, and witnessing a new comedian, named Bass,
roll his heavy breadth about in hard-working attempts to be droll.

As a specimen of manual labour in comedy, we never saw the acting of
this _débutant_ equalled.

We are happy to find that, determined to give "living _English_ dramatists
a clear stage and fair play," the "Council" are bringing forward
a series of stale translations from the _French_ in rapid succession.

The "Married Rake," and "Perfection,"--one by an author no longer
"living," both loans from the _Magasin Théâtral_--have already
appeared

FINE ARTS.

SUFFOLK-STREET GALLERY.--ART-UNION.

The members of this institution have, with their usual liberality,
given the use of their Galleries for the exhibition of the pictures
selected by the prize-holders of the Art-Union of London of the
present year.

The works chosen are 133 in number; and as they are the representatives
of "charming variety," it is naturally to be expected that, in most
instances, the selection does not proclaim that perfect knowledge
of the material from which the 133 jewel-hunters have had each an
opportunity of choosing; nevertheless, it is a blessed reflection,
and a proof of the philanthropic adaptation of society to societies'
means--a beneficent dovetailing--an union of sympathies--that to
every one painter who is disabled from darting suddenly into the
excellencies of his profession, there are, at least, one thousand
"connoisseurs" having an equal degree of free-hearted ignorance in
the matter, willing to extend a ready hand to his weakly efforts,
and without whose generosity he could never place himself within
the observation and patronage of the better informed in art.

As this lottery was formed to give an interest, indiscriminately, to the
mass who compose it, the setting apart so large a sum as £300 for a
prize is, in our humble opinion, anything but well judged.

The painter of a picture worth so high a sum needs not the assistance
which the lottery affords; and although it may be urged, that some
one possessing sufficient taste, but insufficient means to indulge
that taste, might, perchance, obtain the high prize, it is evident
that such bald reasoning is adduced only to support individual
interest.

The principle is, consequently, inimical to those upon which the
Art-Union of London was founded; and, farther, it is most undeniable,
that more general good, and consequent satisfaction, would arise both
to the painter and the public (i.e. that portion of the public whose
subscriptions form the support of the undertaking), had the large prize
been divided into two, four, or even six other, and by no means
inconsiderable ones. We are fully aware of the benefits that have been
conferred and received, and that must still continue to be so,
from this praiseworthy undertaking.

As an observer of these things, we cannot withhold expressing our
opinions upon any part of the system which, in honest thought, appears
imperfect, or not so happily directed as it might be. But should PUNCH
become prosy, his audience will vanish.

To prevent those visitors to this exhibition, who do not profess an
intimacy with the objects herein collected for their amusement, from
being misled by the supposititious circumstance of the highest
prize having commanded the best picture, we beg to point to their
attention the following peculiarities (by no means recommendatory)
in the work selected by the most fortunate of the _jewel-hunters_;
it is catalogued "The Sleeping Beauty," by D.

Maclise, R.A., and assuredly painted with the most independent disdain
for either law or reason. Never has been seen so signal a failure in
attempting to obtain repose by the introduction of so many sleeping
figures.

The appointment of parts to form the general whole, the first and
last aim of every other painter, D.

Maclise, R.A., has most gallantly disregarded. If there be effect, it
certainly is not in the right place, or rather there is no concentration
of effect; it possesses the glare of a coloured print, and that
too of a meretricious sort--incidents there are, but no plot--less
effect upon the animate than the inanimate.

The toilet-table takes precedence of the lady--the couch before the
sleeper--the shadow, in fact, before the substance; and as it is a sure
mark of a vulgar mind to dwell upon the trifles, and lose the substantial--to
scan the dress, and neglect the wearer, so we opine the capabilities
of D.

Maclise, R.A., are brought into requisition to accommodate such beholders.
He has, moreover, carefully avoided any approximation to the vulgarity
of flesh and blood, in his representations of humanity; and has,
therefore, ingeniously sought the delicacy of Dresden china for
his models.

To conclude our notice, we beg to suggest the addition of a torch and
a rosin-box, which, with the assistance of Mr.

Yates, or the Wizard of the North, would render it perfect (whereas,
without these delusive adjuncts, it is not recognisable in its
puppet-show propensities) as a first-rate imitation of the last
scene in a pantomime

THE HEIR OF APPLEBITE.

CHAPTER IV.

HAS A GREAT DEAL TO SAY ABOUT SOME ONE ELSE BESIDES OUR HERO.

[Illustration: K]Kindness was a characteristic of Agamemnon's
disposition, and it is not therefore a matter of surprise that "the
month"--_the_ month, _par excellence_, of "all the months i'the
kalendar"--produced a succession of those annoyances which, in the best
regulated families, are certain to be partially experienced by the
masculine progenitor.

O, bachelors! be warned in time; let not love link you to his flowery
traces and draw you into the temple of Hymen! Be not deluded by the
glowing fallacies of Anacreon and Boccaccio, but remember that they
were bachelors. There is nothing exhilarating in caudle, nor enchanting
in Kensington-gardens, when you are converted into a light porter of
children.

We have been married, and are now seventy-one, and wear a "brown
George;" consequently, we have experience and cool blood in our
veins--two excellent auxiliaries in the formation of a correct judgment
in all matters connected with the heart.

Our pen must have been the pinion of a wild goose, or why these continued
digressions?

Agamemnon's troubles commenced with the first cough of Mrs. Pilcher
on the door-mat. Mrs. P. was the monthly nurse, and monthly nurses always
have a short cough.

Whether this phenomenon arises from the obesity consequent upon
arm-chairs and good living, or from an habitual intimation that
they are present, and have not received half-a-crown, or a systematic
declaration that the throat is dry, and would not object to a gargle
of gin, and perhaps a little water, or--but there is no use hunting
conjecture, when you are all but certain of not catching it.

Mrs.

Pilcher was "the moral of a nurse;" she was about forty-eight and
had, according to her own account, "been the mother of eighteen
lovely babes, born in wedlock," though her most intimate friends
had never been introduced to more than one young gentleman, with a
nose like a wart, and hair like a scrubbing-brush.

When he made his _debut_, he was attired in a suit of blue drugget,
with the pewter order of the parish of St. Clement on his bosom; and
rumour declared that he owed his origin to half-a-crown a week,
paid every Saturday.

Mrs. Pilcher weighed about thirteen stone, including her bundle, and
a pint medicine-bottle, which latter article she invariably carried in
her dexter pocket, filled with a strong tincture of juniper berries,
and extract of cloves.

This mixture had been prescribed to her for what she called a
"sinkingness," which afflicted her about 10 A.M., 11 A.M.

(dinner), 2 P.M., 3 P.M. 4 P.M. 5 P.M. (tea), 7 P.M., 8 P.M.
(supper), 10 P.M., and at uncertain intervals during the night.

Mrs.

Pilcher was a martyr to a delicate appetite, for she could never "make
nothing of a breakfast if she warn't coaxed with a Yarmouth bloater,
a rasher of ham, or a little bit of steak done with the gravy in."

Her luncheon was obliged to be a mutton-chop, or a grilled bone, and a
pint of porter, bread and cheese having the effect of rendering
her "as cross as two sticks, and as sour as werjuice."

Her dinner, and its satellites, tea and supper, were all required
to be hot, strong, and comfortable.

A peculiar hallucination under which she laboured is worthy of
remark.

When eating, it was always her declared conviction that she _never
drank anything_, and when detected coquetting with a pint pot or
a tumbler, she was equally assured that she never _did eat anything
after her breakfast_.

But I didn't see my way----"

"No," cried the minister, "we are all blinded, we are all weakened by a
false ideal of self-sacrifice. It wraps us round with its meshes, and
we can't fight our way out of it.  Mrs. Lapham, what made you feel that
it might be better for three to suffer than one?"

"Why, she did herself.  I know she would die sooner than take him away
from her."

"I supposed so!" cried the minister bitterly.  "And yet she is a
sensible girl, your daughter?"

"She has more common-sense----"

"Of course! But in such a case we somehow think it must be wrong to use
our common-sense. I don't know where this false ideal comes from,
unless it comes from the novels that befool and debauch almost every
intelligence in some degree.  It certainly doesn't come from
Christianity, which instantly repudiates it when confronted with it.
Your daughter believes, in spite of her common-sense, that she ought to
make herself and the man who loves her unhappy, in order to assure the
life-long wretchedness of her sister, whom he doesn't love, simply
because her sister saw him and fancied him first! And I'm sorry to say
that ninety-nine young people out of a hundred--oh, nine hundred and
ninety-nine out of a thousand!--would consider that noble and beautiful
and heroic; whereas you know at the bottom of your hearts that it would
be foolish and cruel and revolting.  You know what marriage is! And
what it must be without love on both sides."

The minister had grown quite heated and red in the face.

"I lose all patience!" he went on vehemently.  "This poor child of
yours has somehow been brought to believe that it will kill her sister
if her sister does not have what does not belong to her, and what it is
not in the power of all the world, or any soul in the world, to give
her.  Her sister will suffer--yes, keenly!--in heart and in pride; but
she will not die.  You will suffer too, in your tenderness for her; but
you must do your duty.  You must help her to give up.  You would be
guilty if you did less.  Keep clearly in mind that you are doing right,
and the only possible good.  And God be with you!"

"HE talked sense, Persis," said Lapham gently, as he mounted to his
wife's side in the buggy and drove slowly homeward through the dusk.

"Yes, he talked sense," she admitted.  But she added bitterly, "I
guess, if he had it to DO! Oh, he's right, and it's got to be done.
There ain't any other way for it.  It's sense; and, yes, it's justice."
They walked to their door after they left the horse at the livery
stable around the corner, where Lapham kept it.  "I want you should
send Irene up to our room as soon as we get in, Silas."

"Why, ain't you going to have any supper first?" faltered Lapham with
his latch-key in the lock.

OF KENTUCKY, 1776.

By the end of 1775 Kentucky had been occupied by those who were
permanently to hold it.

Ramsey gives the equally prejudiced, but golden- instead of

lovingly lingered in their old age.

To old men the long-vanished stockades seemed to have held a band of
brothers, who were ever generous, hospitable, courteous, and
fearless, always ready to help one another, never envious, never
flinching from any foe.[7] Neither account is accurate; but the
last is quite as near the truth as the first.

On the border, as elsewhere, but with the different qualities in yet
bolder contrast, there was much both I of good and bad, of shiftless
and resolute honesty.

Many of the hunters were mere restless wanderers, who soon surrendered
their clearings to small farming squatters, but a degree less
shiftless than themselves; the latter brought the ground a little
more under cultivation, and then likewise left it and wandered
onwards, giving place to the set of frontiersmen, the steady men
who had come to stay.

But often the with. first hunters could themselves stayed and grew up as
farmers and landed proprietors.[8] Many of the earliest pioneers,
including most of their leaders, founded families, which took root
in the land and flourish to this day, the children, grandchildren,
and the later.

"Well," said Lapham, with the hungriness of unsatisfied anxiety in his
tone.  When Corey's card was brought into the family-room where he and
Penelope were sitting, he went into the parlour to find him.  "I guess
Penelope wants to see you," he said; and, indicating the family-room,
he added, "She's in there," and did not go back himself.

Corey made his way to the girl's presence with open trepidation, which
was not allayed by her silence and languor.  She sat in the chair where
she had sat the other night, but she was not playing with a fan now.

He came toward her, and then stood faltering.  A faint smile quivered
over her face at the spectacle of his subjection.  "Sit down, Mr.
Corey," she said.  "There's no reason why we shouldn't talk it over
quietly; for I know you will think I'm right."

"I'm sure of that," he answered hopefully.  "When I saw that your
father knew of it to-day, I asked him to let me see you again.  I'm
afraid that I broke my promise to you--technically----"

"It had to be broken." He took more courage at her words.  "But I've
only come to do whatever you say, and not to be an--annoyance to
you----"

"Yes, you have to know; but I couldn't tell you before.  Now they all
think I should."

A tremor of anxiety passed over the young man's face, on which she kept
her eyes steadily fixed.

"We supposed it--it was--Irene----"

He remained blank a moment, and then he said with a smile of relief, of
deprecation, of protest, of amazement, of compassion--

"OH! Never! Never for an instant! How could you think such a thing? It
was impossible! I never thought of her.  But I see--I see! I can
explain--no, there's nothing to explain! I have never knowingly done or
said a thing from first to last to make you think that.  I see how
terrible it is!" he said; but he still smiled, as if he could not take
it seriously.  "I admired her beauty--who could help doing that?--and I
thought her very good and sensible.  Why, last winter in Texas, I told
Stanton about our meeting in Canada, and we agreed--I only tell you to
show you how far I always was from what you thought--that he must come
North and try to see her, and--and--of course, it all sounds very
silly!--and he sent her a newspaper with an account of his ranch in
it----"

"She thought it came from you."

"Oh, good heavens! He didn't tell me till after he'd done it.  But he
did it for a part of our foolish joke.  And when I met your sister
again, I only admired her as before.  I can see, now, how I must have
seemed to be seeking her out; but it was to talk of you with her--I
never talked of anything else if I could help it, except when I changed
the subject because I was ashamed to be always talking of you.  I see
how distressing it is for all of you.  But tell me that you believe me!"

"Yes, I must.  It's all been our mistake----"

"It has indeed! But there's no mistake about my loving you, Penelope,"
he said; and the old-fashioned name, at which she had often mocked, was
sweet to her from his lips.

"That only makes it worse!" she answered.

"Oh no!" he gently protested.  "It makes it better.  It makes it right.
How is it worse? How is it wrong?"

"Can't you see? You must understand all now! Don't you see that if she
believed so too, and if she----" She could not go on.

"Did she--did your sister--think that too?" gasped Corey.

"She used to talk with me about you; and when you say you care for me
now, it makes me feel like the vilest hypocrite in the world.  That day
you gave her the list of books, and she came down to Nantasket, and
went on about you, I helped her to flatter herself--oh! I don't see how
she can forgive me.  But she knows I can never forgive myself! That's
the reason she can do it.  I can see now," she went on, "how I must
have been trying to get you from her.  I can't endure it! The only way
is for me never to see you or speak to you again!" She laughed
forlornly.  "That would be pretty hard on you, if you cared."

"I do care--all the world!"

"Well, then, it would if you were going to keep on caring.  You won't
long, if you stop coming now."

"Is this all, then? Is it the end?"

"It's--whatever it is.  I can't get over the thought of her.  Once I
thought I could, but now I see that I can't. It seems to grow worse.
Sometimes I feel as if it would drive me crazy."

He sat looking at her with lacklustre eyes.  The light suddenly came
back into them.  "Do you think I could love you if you had been false
to her? I know you have been true to her, and truer still to yourself.
I never tried to see her, except with the hope of seeing you too.  
But he has a right equally strong to his own service or labor; yet
both must yield to the paramount right of the Government to the services
of both or either to suppress the rebellion. There is not a single
word in the Federal Constitution which, either by inference or express
declaration, exempts slaves, more than any other persons, from the
call of the Federal Government to aid in suppressing a rebellion.

Such is the construction given, by the South to the so-called Confederate
constitution, which is much more stringent than ours in that
respect, for it recognizes slaves as property; yet, the rebel
authorities, the rebel congress and government, force slaves, even
by conscription, to perform military duty--to dig the trenches--to
make the earthworks--to erect the barracks and arsenals--to help
to make the cannon, small arms, and powder, and vessels of war--to
construct the fortifications--to transport the provisions, munitions,
and cannon for their armies, together with the tents and military
equipage--to raise the food indispensable for the support of their
military forces--and, of course, they would, _if they dare_, put
arms in their hands to meet us on the battle field.

It is clear, then, not as a confiscation of property (which is also
constitutional under certain circumstances), but as _persons_, that
we have a right to the service of the slaves as well as of their
masters to suppress the rebellion.

But it is only by emancipation (with compensation for loss of their
services by loyal men) that the slaves can be called into our army,
and used to suppress the rebellion.

A call by the President for the slaves to serve in our armies, to
risk their lives and shed their blood for the Union, accompanied
by the declaration that they were still slaves, and, upon the
termination of the war, such as survived would be restored to their
masters, with whom their wives and children must still remain in
bondage, would be an atrocious crime, as well as the climax of all
absurdities.

No; it is only by emancipation that the services of the slaves can or
ought to be obtained for the suppression of the rebellion.
The Emancipation Proclamation then of the President, with compensation
to loyal masters, is most clearly constitutional during the
continuance of the war, and as a war measure to suppress the rebellion
and save the Union, and such must be the decision of the Supreme
Court of the United States, to which tribunal the President has
properly submitted the final arbitrament of the constitutional
question.

It is true, when the rebellion is crushed, the President can issue
no new emancipation proclamation.

But neither can he then recall or modify the one already issued;
and if he had the power to recall the proclamation, it would be an
act of perfidy unparalleled in the history of the world.

The nation would be so utterly disgraced by such bad faith as would be
involved in the revocation of the Emancipation Proclamation, as to
earn the contempt of all honest and honorable men, and the loss
of sympathy of the industrial classes and working men of Europe,
whose rulers would then no longer fear to recognize or aid the South.

It was the magnificent uprising of the working classes of England in
favor of the Union, that alone saved both countries from a bloody
and disastrous war.

The Emancipation Proclamation being, as we have seen, clearly
constitutional, as a war measure, with a view to save the Union,
was it, as such, wise and expedient?

We have seen that the rebel South, even by conscription, when necessary,
used slaves for military purposes, and those not used directly in
that way are required to raise breadstuff's and provisions (instead
of cotton), to supply the Confederate army.

Indeed the debates of Congress for many years past, will show that
the South boasted, not vainly, of their great military strength,
because they declared that, while the slaves would be used in raising
provisions to supply their forces, the whole white population capable
of bearing arms could then be called into the field.

This constituted, as they declared, their _great military strength_. And
is it not then a most important war measure, to deprive them of that
all-powerful and efficient weapon: which, we have seen, can only be
done by emancipation?
Now, let us suppose that while we refuse the use of the colored race,
whether bond or free, in aid of the war, they are used for that
purpose by the South, what would be the result? By the census of
1860, the whole population of the United States was 31,445,080, of
which there were white, 26,975,575; free colored, 487,996; slaves,
3,953,760; total, of colored, 4,441,756, of which there were in the
seceded States 3,653,110, and in the loyal States, 788,446.

Add the whites in the seceded States, 5,449,463, would thus make the
whole population of those States, by the census of 1860, 9,102,573.

In the loyal States, the whole population was 22,342,507; of which
21,553,861 were white, and 788,646 colored.

Now then, if the colored race, as we have seen, in the seceding States,
are used for war purposes by them and not by us, the relative
number of opposing forces would be as follows: Loyal States,
21,553,861; seceded States, 9,102,573; difference in favor of the
Loyal States, 12,451,288.

Now, to begin the process, add to the whites in the Loyal States
the free colored, and the total number is 22,342,507; seceded States,
9,102,573; difference in favor of the Loyal States, 13,239,934.

Continuing the process, if we deduct by the emancipation policy the
whole colored population of the seceded States, the result would
be, Loyal States, 22,342,507; seceded States, 5,449,463.

But if, concluding the process, by the emancipation policy we not
only deduct the colored race from the aid of the South, but add it
in aid of the Loyal States, the result would be, Loyal States,
25,995,617; seceded States, 5,449,463; difference in favor of Loyal
States, 20,456,154.

Thus the policy opposed to emancipation and to the use of the colored
race by us in the war, mates the difference in our favor as against
the South only 12,451,288, whereas the difference in our favor by
the emancipation policy of the President is 20,546,154.

Deduct from this the above 12,451,288; final difference, 8,094,866.

Thus we see that, by the President's policy, there is, in effect, a
gain to the Loyal States equivalent to more than eight millions of people,
more than 200,000 of whom are already soldiers in the Union army, all
of whom must be disbanded if Mr. Lincoln's policy was erroneous. Will
any say that a policy which makes a difference in the relative forces
of the two contending parties of more than eight millions of people
in favor of the North, and which has already increased our army
200,000, is not a most important war measure, aiding us to suppress
the rebellion and save the Government?

and, therefore, it is a policy eminently calculated to preserve and
perpetuate the Union. Indeed, it is this measure which renders the
maintenance of the Union certain, and, without it, the Union is
subjected to great peril.

As, then, the emancipation policy of the President is not only wise,
beneficent, and constitutional, but renders certain the preservation
of the Union, while that of his opponents subjects it to imminent
peril, I go for the reëlection of Mr. Lincoln. I go for him as a
_Union man_, and because his emancipation policy will certainly
save the Union; and I go against his opponent, because, however
loyal he may be, and however sincere his desire to save the Union,
practically he is a disunionist, because, independent of the Chicago
McClellan platform, his anti-emancipation and anti-negro policy
subjects the Union to imminent peril.

Now, with me, in this, as in all preceding elections, the preservation
and perpetuation of the Union constituted the great transcendent
question, involving the liberty of our country and mankind, and I
can give no vote which subjects it to the slightest peril.

Save the Union, and all else will be added in time (including the
_ultimate_ downfall of Slavery, which I predicted and advocated in
January, 1844), has been the doctrine of my life.

To that doctrine I still adhere, but support the President's
emancipation policy _now_, because it is the most efficient, if not the
only means of saving and perpetuating the Union. I opposed
emancipation when it was unconstitutional as a _peace measure_, and
because I knew it would cause civil war, invite foreign intervention,
and endanger the Union. I support emancipation now, because it
is constitutional as a war measure, greatly diminishes the danger of
foreign intervention, and insures the maintenance and perpetuity of the
Union. I supported Judge Douglas and opposed the election of Mr.

Lincoln in 1860, because I believed it would imperil the Union. While
always denying that his election would justify disunion, I feared
that the rebellion would be the result.

In voting against Mr.
Lincoln in 1860, I did so to save the Union from peril. In voting for
him now, it is to suppress the rebellion and maintain the Union. It
is not for Mr.

Lincoln as a man (however worthy he may be), that I now vote--I
vote for principles--I vote for the Union--and in supporting him,
I vote for the best, if not the only means to maintain and perpetuate
the Union.

But there is another principle of vital importance involved in this
election.

The South, under the banner of Slavery, proceeded to secede from
the Union, immediately after the result of the Presidential election
of 1860 was made known.

South Carolina seceded in December, 1860.

Mississippi followed early in January, 1861, and the Cotton States
all followed during that and the succeeding month of February.

Now, Mr.

Lincoln was not and could not be inaugurated as President until
March, 1861.

The South did not and would not wait for his inaugural address of
that date to know, under the new condition of affairs, what would
be the policy of his Administration.

They did not and would not wait for any measures of his Administration,
much less any act of the Government or of Congress, but proceeded
to secede merely because Mr.

Lincoln had been constitutionally elected to the Presidency by the
people of the United States. Such an act was an overthrow of the great
fundamental principle of all free government, namely, that the
majority shall govern under the forms of the Constitution.

It was an attack upon the right of suffrage, an assault upon the ballot
box and the great principle of an elective President, as provided
in our Constitution, and which lies at the very basis of free
institutions.

That principle is the vital element of our existence. It is 'the casing
air' of liberty. Take it away, and freedom instantly expires.

The right of suffrage is the great American right of every citizen,
rich or poor, humble or exalted. It is the great palladium of our
liberty. It is a Government, like a mighty pyramid, reposing on its broad
and immovable base, the will and affections of the people. It is the
people's Government, and therefore the people maintain it, and
with us two millions of volunteers have rushed to its support.

Therefore, while it is the best Government in peace, it is the
strongest in war.

But secession because of the election of a President, is not only war
upon the Union, but war upon the elective franchise, the great
fundamental principle of free government, and without which it is
but a fleeting shadow.

Democrats--people of all parties--my countrymen, while you are asked
now by the Chicago Convention to vote against Mr.

Lincoln, you would nullify by that very vote the right of suffrage,
because, what is that suffrage worth, what is your vote but an empty
form, if it may not elect your President?

But if, because the minority who have voted against you, dissatisfied
with your choice, can rebel, make war upon you, because you thus voted,
and set up another President for that minority by force of arms, what
is that but to say that the majority shall not rule; that the right of
suffrage shall be nullified; that the Constitution, under which that
vote was given, shall be overthrown? This is what the rebellion has
done in attempting to destroy the Republic, merely because of the
election of Mr. Lincoln. This arrogant and insolent slave-holding
oligarchy would not even wait to hear what the President of your choice
would say. They treated the President of your choice, and therefore
they treated you and the Constitution under which you acted, with
scorn and defiance.

So long as you would act with them, so long as the Northern parasites
would adhere to the Southern upas tree of Slavery, so long as the
'mudsills' of the North, as they arrogantly called you, would obey
the orders of their Southern masters, so long as you would be their
slaves, they would permit the President to be inaugurated.

But so soon as you elected a President against their dictation,
then your suffrages should be nullified by the rebellion of a
minority against the majority.

What is this but to say, that the majority shall not elect a
President, and thus render the right of suffrage an empty form,
striking at the fundamental principle of free government, and
substituting the _bayonets_ of the minority for the _ballots_ of
the majority of the people?

Freemen of America, is it possible that by voting against Mr. Lincoln
now because of the Southern rebellion, you will thus declare that
the election of a President by the people is not to be maintained,
but that his reëlection is to be defeated, and that his authority,
as your President and as your representative, is therefore never
to extend over the _whole United States_, because a rebellious
minority oppose it by force of arms?

This is one of the transcendent issues involved in this contest. It
is in fact the great question whether the majority shall rule or
the minority--whether self-government is an unreal mockery, or
whether it is indeed a God-given right of _man_, born in the image
of his Maker.

You voted that Mr.

Lincoln should be President of the _whole United States_.
That was your decision at the ballot box. Has it been obeyed? No: an
arrogant slave-holding minority has rebelled against it, and,
within the boundaries of the area occupied by that minority, has
suppressed your election by the bayonet, and substituted Jefferson
Davis, one of the rebel leaders, in place of Abraham Lincoln.

Within the limits of that rebellion, the power, under the Constitution,
which you devolved upon Abraham Lincoln, has been nullified by force
of arms, and now, if you abandon the war, or defeat his reëlection,
your choice will have been nullified, and he never will have exercised
throughout the United States the power given to him by your suffrages
under the Constitution.

Now the party in the North thus acquiescing in this destruction of
the right of suffrage, dares to assume the sacred name of Democracy,
which you know is but Anglicized Greek, meaning the _power of the
people_.

Shade of the immortal Jackson!

the father and founder of the Democratic party, burst the cerements of
the Hermitage, and blast with the thunders of New Orleans the
wretched traitors who thus dare to profane the sacred name under
which you were chosen President of the United States.

But there is another grave objection to the McClellan platform
adopted at Chicago.

It is its _intentional ambiguity_. The Convention was composed of unionists
and disunionists, of peace and war Democrats, as they style themselves,
and the platform was adapted to suit the views of both these parties in
and out of the Convention.

It was a platform upon which the temple of Janus was to be closed, but
with side doors at either extremity, into one of which the peace men
with their olive branches should enter, and the war men in full
military array in the other, and the lion and the lamb meet together
in the centre in cordial agreement.

But, it appears that the war men in this case were only asses in lions'
skins, for in the compromise between antagonistic principles and
candidates, the peace men got far the better of the bargain.

While there were some vague and glittering generalities in favor of the
Union, they were connected with conditions which rendered the destruction
of the Union certain, namely, an armistice and cessation of hostilities,
accompanied by the false and flagitious declaration, calculated
to encourage the enemies of our country at home and abroad, namely,
that the war to suppress the rebellion was a failure.

Remember, soldiers, that the McClellan platform declares that your
battles are failures; that your blood has been shed in vain; that
your arms can never crush the rebellion; that you are inferior in
courage to the slave-holding rebels; that you must admit your defeat,
throw down your muskets, return in disgrace to your homes, disband
the army, lay up the navy, recall Generals Grant, Sherman, Sheridan,
Meade, and Gilmore, and Admirals Farragut, Porter, Dupont, Davis,
and Winslow, and leave it to the civilians of Chicago, Vallandigham,
Harris, Long, PENDLETON, and others, to negotiate a peace.

Now what is an armistice? It is defined to be a suspension of the
war for a limited period. There may be conditions added, but none are
named in the McClellan Chicago platform. Of course, then, it means
a cessation of hostilities by land and sea. Indeed, the platform is
weaker than this, for it proposes directly a 'cessation of hostilities,'
not by land only, or by sea only, but, of course, by _both, as the
words are general_.

Now then, the blockade of the rebel ports, and the capture or
destruction of blockade runners and their cargoes, is war upon the
ocean.

This blockade, then, is to be abandoned during the armistice, for there
is to be a cessation of hostilities upon the ocean and the
land.

During this interval of peace, when there is to be no blockade of the
Southern ports, what is to follow? By their own accounts and estimates,
the Confederates have within their limits, in cotton (at present prices),
tobacco, and naval stores, a value exceeding one billion of dollars
in gold. Now then, so soon as the armistice was agreed upon, the war
upon the ocean, including the blockade, having ceased, the whole of
this cotton, tobacco, and naval stores, would be shipped to Europe,
or partly to Nassau, on the way to Europe, and this enormous amount
realized by the Confederate government in gold. We know what tremendous
disasters have been produced by the cotton famine in England, France,
and other countries. Now, the first effect of such shipments would
be the total ruin of all our manufactures of cotton and other textile
fabrics. But another still more serious result would follow. We know
that Louis Napoleon is the bitter enemy of the Union; we know that
he has again and again declared that we could not suppress the
rebellion; that he has earnestly thrice endeavored to persuade the
British Government to unite with him in acknowledging the independence
of the South--twice through efforts made directly upon the British
Cabinet, and once through Roebuck and Lindsay, members of the House
of Commons, to induce it by a parliamentary vote to compel the
British Ministry to unite with the Emperor in acknowledging the
independence of the South.

That Louis Napoleon is our bitter enemy, is proved also by the
French-Mexican war, in which England, and even Spain, separated
from him.

It is proved also by the diplomatic correspondence of Jefferson Davis,
and by his friendly and approving recognition of the establishment
of the French Imperial Government in Mexico. It is further proved
by Louis Napoleon's own letter, in which he declared, that one of
the objects of the Mexican war was the establishment of the equilibrium
of the Latin race upon the American continent.

It is farther demonstrated by the proceedings of the French in Mexico,
and especially recently at Matamoras, in the mutual aid given and
received by the French and Confederate forces.

Now, what is the meaning of establishing the equilibrium of the Latin
race on the '_American continent_'? In the first place, it means
European military intervention; in the second place, it means to embrace
not only Mexico, _but the whole Latin race on the American continent_.
By the Latin race is included all Spanish America. It means, then, in
the future, if our Government is overthrown, that all Spanish America,
from the northern boundary of Mexico to Cape Horn, is to be consolidated
into one great Power under imperial sway. It means to include in this
vast empire the command of the Isthmus of Tehauntepec, the route
by Central America (about which Louis Napoleon has written so much),
by Honduras and Chiriqui, but more especially the Panama, as also
the Atrato routes.

In the great future, whoever commands these routes, especially together
with that of the Isthmus of Suez, which I visited a few months
since, and which Louis Napoleon has nearly completed, will command
the commerce of the world, and, as a consequence, ultimately control
the institutions of the world.

Such are the tremendous problems teeming in the brain of Napoleon the
Third, and all, as he believes, depending upon the destruction of the
American Union. I speak of what I know from a residence now of nearly
two years in Europe. Thus it is that Louis Napoleon intends to bring us
within the centrifugal gravitation of the European balance of power.
This wonderful man proposes to extend this system from the old continents
to the new, embracing both, and thus hold in his grasp the equilibrium--the
balance of power of the world. We may well imagine what that equilibrium
will be when Napoleon the Third shall hold the balance in his hands.

Already he has considerable possessions (insular and continental)
in North and South America, and Mexico, under Maximilian, is
substantially a French dependency.

He holds Algiers. He is colonizing Egypt (as I myself saw this year)
by his railroads and canals. He has seized and colonized Cochin
China and Annam. He has made Italy a dependency on the bayonets of
Franco. Now then, under these circumstances, when the blockade shall
have terminated, and Jefferson Davis, who is quite as ambitious
and even more talented than Louis Napoleon, shall hold in his hand
more than a billion of dollars' worth of Southern products ready
for immediate shipment, may he not, and will he not say, through
his most able and adroit diplomatic representative at Paris,
'Recognize the independence of the South, and all these products
shall be shipped for sale in France, and to French manufacturers,'
and thus enable France to crush for the present the cotton manufacturers
of all the rest of the world.

It is well known in Paris that Mr. Slidell is upon terms of the most
intimate association with Louis Napoleon, and has thoroughly
convinced him that we cannot suppress the rebellion.

Is it not, then, clear, anxious as Napoleon is for the success of
the South, that he would, in the event of McClellan's election, at
once recognize Southern independence.

Indeed, it is the boast of the Confederate leaders in Europe, since
the adoption of the platform at Chicago, that, upon the election
of their candidates, without waiting four months for the inauguration
in March next, Napoleon will AT ONCE recognize the Confederate
government.

Indeed, I do not doubt, from the circumstantial evidence (although I do
not know the fact), that there is already a secret understanding
between Jefferson Davis and Napoleon the Third to recognize the
independence of the South upon the election of the Chicago candidates.

Why wait four months, until the 4th of March next, when the American
people, by indorsing the Chicago platform, shall have declared for
peace, with the additional announcement in that platform, that the
war for the suppression of the rebellion has failed?

As
long as this crisis decently kept its distance, I could look at it with
an impartial eye; but now that it seems at hand, I find that, while my
reason is still acquiescent, my nerves are disposed to--excuse the
phrase--kick. I ask myself, what have I done nothing for, all my life,
and lived as a gentleman should, upon the earnings of somebody else, in
the possession of every polite taste and feeling that adorns leisure,
if I'm to come to this at last? And I find no satisfactory answer.  I
say to myself that I might as well have yielded to the pressure all
round me, and gone to work, as Tom has."

Mrs. Corey looked at him forlornly, divining the core of real
repugnance that existed in his self-satire.

"I assure you, my dear," he continued, "that the recollection of what I
suffered from the Laphams at that dinner of yours is an anguish still.
It wasn't their behaviour,--they behaved well enough--or ill enough;
but their conversation was terrible.  Mrs. Lapham's range was strictly
domestic; and when the Colonel got me in the library, he poured mineral
paint all over me, till I could have been safely warranted not to crack
or scale in any climate.  I suppose we shall have to see a good deal of
them.  They will probably come here every Sunday night to tea.  It's a
perspective without a vanishing-point."

"It may not be so bad, after all," said his wife; and she suggested for
his consolation that he knew very little about the Laphams yet.

He assented to the fact.  "I know very little about them, and about my
other fellow-beings. I dare say that I should like the Laphams better
if I knew them better.  But in any case, I resign myself.  And we must
keep in view the fact that this is mainly Tom's affair, and if his
affections have regulated it to his satisfaction, we must be content."

"Oh yes," sighed Mrs. Corey.  "And perhaps it won't turn out so badly.
It's a great comfort to know that you feel just as I do about it."

"I do," said her husband, "and more too."

It was she and her daughters who would be chiefly annoyed by the Lapham
connection; she knew that.  But she had to begin to bear the burden by
helping her husband to bear his light share of it.  To see him so
depressed dismayed her, and she might well have reproached him more
sharply than she did for showing so much indifference, when she was so
anxious, at first.  But that would not have served any good end now.
She even answered him patiently when he asked her, "What did you say to
Tom when he told you it was the other one?"

"What could I say? I could do nothing, but try to take back what I had
said against her."

"Yes, you had quite enough to do, I suppose.  It's an awkward business.
If it had been the pretty one, her beauty would have been our excuse.
But the plain one--what do you suppose attracted him in her?"

Mrs. Corey sighed at the futility of the question.  "Perhaps I did her
injustice.  I only saw her a few moments.  Perhaps I got a false
impression.  I don't think she's lacking in sense, and that's a great
thing.  She'll be quick to see that we don't mean unkindness, and
can't, by anything we say or do, when she's Tom's wife." She pronounced
the distasteful word with courage, and went on: "The pretty one might
not have been able to see that.  She might have got it into her head
that we were looking down on her; and those insipid people are terribly
stubborn.  We can come to some understanding with this one; I'm sure of
that." She ended by declaring that it was now their duty to help Tom
out of his terrible predicament.

"Oh, even the Lapham cloud has a silver lining," said Corey.  "In fact,
it seems really to have all turned out for the best, Anna; though it's
rather curious to find you the champion of the Lapham side, at last.
Confess, now, that the right girl has secretly been your choice all
along, and that while you sympathise with the wrong one, you rejoice in
the tenacity with which the right one is clinging to her own!" He added
with final seriousness, "It's just that she should, and, so far as I
understand the case, I respect her for it."

"Oh yes," sighed Mrs. Corey.  "It's natural, and it's right." But she
added, "I suppose they're glad of him on any terms."

"That is what I have been taught to believe," said her husband.  "When
shall we see our daughter-in-law elect? I find myself rather impatient
to have that part of it over."

Mrs. Corey hesitated.  "Tom thinks we had better not call, just yet."

"She has told him of your terrible behaviour when you called before?"

"No, Bromfield! She couldn't be so vulgar as that?"

"But anything short of it?"


XXI.


LAPHAM was gone a fortnight.  He was in a sullen humour when he came
back, and kept himself shut close within his own den at the office the
first day.  He entered it in the morning without a word to his clerks
as he passed through the outer room, and he made no sign throughout the
forenoon, except to strike savagely on his desk-bell from time to time,
and send out to Walker for some book of accounts or a letter-file. His
boy confidentially reported to Walker that the old man seemed to have
got a lot of papers round; and at lunch the book-keeper said to Corey,
at the little table which they had taken in a corner together, in
default of seats at the counter, "Well, sir, I guess there's a cold
wave coming."

Corey looked up innocently, and said, "I haven't read the weather
report."

"Yes, sir," Walker continued, "it's coming.  Areas of rain along the
whole coast, and increased pressure in the region of the private
office.  Storm-signals up at the old man's door now."

Corey perceived that he was speaking figuratively, and that his
meteorology was entirely personal to Lapham.  "What do you mean?" he
asked, without vivid interest in the allegory, his mind being full of
his own tragi-comedy.

"Why, just this: I guess the old man's takin' in sail.  And I guess
he's got to.  As I told you the first time we talked about him, there
don't any one know one-quarter as much about the old man's business as
the old man does himself; and I ain't betraying any confidence when I
say that I guess that old partner of his has got pretty deep into his
books.  I guess he's over head and ears in 'em, and the old man's gone
in after him, and he's got a drownin' man's grip round his neck.  There
seems to be a kind of a lull--kind of a dead calm, I call it--in the
paint market just now; and then again a ten-hundred-thousand-dollar man
don't build a hundred-thousand-dollar house without feeling the drain,
unless there's a regular boom.  And just now there ain't any boom at
all.  Oh, I don't say but what the old man's got anchors to windward;
guess he HAS; but if he's GOIN' to leave me his money, I wish he'd left
it six weeks ago.  Yes, sir, I guess there's a cold wave comin'; but
you can't generally 'most always tell, as a usual thing, where the old
man's concerned, and it's ONLY a guess." Walker began to feed in his
breaded chop with the same nervous excitement with which he abandoned
himself to the slangy and figurative excesses of his talks.  Corey had
listened with a miserable curiosity and compassion up to a certain
moment, when a broad light of hope flashed upon him.  It came from
Lapham's potential ruin; and the way out of the labyrinth that had
hitherto seemed so hopeless was clear enough, if another's disaster
would befriend him, and give him the opportunity to prove the
unselfishness of his constancy.  He thought of the sum of money that
was his own, and that he might offer to lend, or practically give, if
the time came; and with his crude hopes and purposes formlessly
exulting in his heart, he kept on listening with an unchanged
countenance.

Walker could not rest till he had developed the whole situation, so far
as he knew it.  "Look at the stock we've got on hand.  There's going to
be an awful shrinkage on that, now! And when everybody is shutting
down, or running half-time, the works up at Lapham are going full chip,
just the same as ever.  Well, it's his pride.  morning shine, gambolled

Rogers took the chair that was not offered him, and sat with his
hat-brim on his knees, and its crown pointed towards Lapham.  "I want
to know what you are going to do," he answered with sufficient
self-possession.

"I'll tell you, first, what I've done," said Lapham.  "I've been to
Dubuque, and I've found out all about that milling property you turned
in on me.  Did you know that the G. L. & P. had leased the P. Y. & X.?"

"I some suspected that it might."

"Did you know it when you turned the property in on me?  Did you know
that the G. L. & P. wanted to buy the mills?"

"I presumed the road would give a fair price for them," said Rogers,
winking his eyes in outward expression of inwardly blinking the point.

"You lie," said Lapham, as quietly as if correcting him in a slight
error; and Rogers took the word with equal sang froid.  "You knew the
road wouldn't give a fair price for the mills.  You knew it would give
what it chose, and that I couldn't help myself, when you let me take
them.  You're a thief, Milton K. To be quite frank, absolutism is a
myth coming down from the days of Kublai Khan when he so proudly
built his Khan-baligh (the Cambaluc of Marco Polo and the forebear
of modern Peking) and filled it with his troops who so soon vanished
like the snows of winter. An elaborate pretence, a deliberate policy
of make-believe, ever since those days invested Imperial Edicts with
a majesty which they have never really possessed, the effacement of
the sovereign during the Nineteenth Century contributing to the
legend that there existed in the capital a Grand and Fearful Panjandrum
for whom no miracle was too great and to whom people and officials owed
trembling obedience.

In reality, the office of emperor was never more than a politico-
religious concept, translated for the benefit of the masses into
socio-economic ordinances.

These pronouncements, cast in the form of periodic homilies called
Edicts, were the ritual of government; their purpose was instructional
rather than mandatory; they were designed to teach and keep alive
the State-theory that the Emperor was the High Priest of the Nation
and that obedience to the morality of the Golden Age, which had
been inculcated by all the philosophers since Confucius and Mencius
flourished twenty-five centuries ago, would not only secure universal
happiness but contribute to national greatness.

The office of Emperor was thus heavenly rather than terrestrial, and
suasion, not arms, was the most potent argument used in everyday
life. The amazing reply (i.e., amazing to foreigners) made by
the great Emperor K'ang-hsi in the tremendous Eighteenth Century controversy
between the Jesuit and the Dominican missionaries, which ruined the
prospects of China's ever becoming Roman Catholic and which the
Pope refused to accept--that the custom of ancestor-worship was
political and not religious--was absolutely correct, POLITICS IN
CHINA UNDER THE EMPIRE BEING ONLY A SYSTEM OF NATIONAL CONTROL
EXERCISED BY INCULCATING OBEDIENCE TO FOREBEARS.

The great efforts which the Manchus made from the end of the Sixteenth
Century (when they were still a small Manchurian Principality
striving for the succession to the Dragon Throne and launching
desperate attacks on the Great Wall of China) to receive from the
Dalai Lama, as well as from the lesser Pontiffs of Tibet and Mongolia,
high-sounding religious titles, prove conclusively that dignities
other than mere possession of the Throne were held necessary to
give solidity to a reign which began in militarism and which would
collapse as the Mongol rule had collapsed by a mere Palace revolution
unless an effective MORAL title were somehow won.

Nor was the Manchu military Conquest, even after they had entered
Peking, so complete as has been represented by historians.

The Manchus were too small a handful, even with their Mongol and Chinese
auxiliaries, to do more than defeat the Ming armies and obtain
the submission of the chief cities of China. It is well- known to
students of their administrative methods, that whilst they reigned
over China they RULED only in company with the Chinese, the system in
force being a dual control which, beginning on the Grand Council and
in the various great Boards and Departments in the capital, proceeded
as far as the provincial chief cities, but stopped short there so
completely and absolutely that the huge chains of villages and burgs
had their historic autonomy virtually untouched and lived on as
they had always lived.

The elaborate system of examinations, with the splendid official honours
reserved for successful students which was adopted by the Dynasty,
not only conciliated Chinese society but provided a vast body
of men whose interest lay in maintaining the new conquest; and
thus Literature, which had always been the door to preferment, became
not only one of the instruments of government, but actually the
advocate of an alien rule.

With their persons and properties safe, and their women-folk protected
by an elaborate set of capitulations from being requisitioned for the
harems of the invaders, small wonder if the mass of Chinese welcomed
a firm administration after the frightful disorders which had
torn the country during the last days of the Mings. [Footnote:
This most interesting point--the immunity of Chinese women from forced
marriage with Manchus--has been far too little noticed by historians
though it throws a flood of light on the sociological aspects of
the Manchu conquest.

"I haven't ever hid anything from you, Persis, well you asked
me, and it's too late to begin now.  I'm in a fix.  I'll tell you what
kind of a fix, if you think it'll do you any good; but I guess you'll
be satisfied to know that it's a fix."

"How much of a one?" she asked with a look of grave, steady courage in
her eyes.

"Well, I don't know as I can tell, just yet," said Lapham, avoiding
this look.  "Things have been dull all the fall, but I thought they'd
brisk up come winter.  They haven't.  There have been a lot of
failures, and some of 'em owed me, and some of 'em had me on their
paper; and----" Lapham stopped.

"And what?" prompted his wife.

He hesitated before he added, "And then--Rogers."

"I'm to blame for that," said Mrs. Lapham.  "I forced you to it."

"No; I was as willing to go into it as what you were," answered Lapham.
"I don't want to blame anybody."

Mrs. Lapham had a woman's passion for fixing responsibility; she could
not help saying, as soon as acquitted, "I warned you against him,
Silas.  I told you not to let him get in any deeper with you."

"Oh yes.  I had to help him to try to get my money back.  I might as
well poured water into a sieve.  And now--" Lapham stopped.

"Don't be afraid to speak out to me, Silas Lapham.  If it comes to the
worst, I want to know it--I've got to know it.  What did I ever care
for the money? I've had a happy home with you ever since we were
married, and I guess I shall have as long as you live, whether we go on
to the Back Bay, or go back to the old house at Lapham.  I know who's
to blame, and I blame myself.  It was my forcing Rogers on to you." She
came back to this with her helpless longing, inbred in all Puritan
souls, to have some one specifically suffer for the evil in the world,
even if it must be herself.

"It hasn't come to the worst yet, Persis," said her husband.  "But I
shall have to hold up on the new house a little while, till I can see
where I am."

"I shouldn't care if we had to sell it," cried his wife, in passionate
self-condemnation. "I should be GLAD if we had to, as far as I'm
concerned."

"I shouldn't," said Lapham.

THE morning postman brought Mrs. Lapham a letter from Irene, which was
chiefly significant because it made no reference whatever to the writer
or her state of mind.  It gave the news of her uncle's family; it told
of their kindness to her; her cousin Will was going to take her and his
sisters ice-boating on the river, when it froze.

Don't you think they could get along without me
there?"

"No; couldn't work it at all," cried the Colonel.  "Let's all go.
Unless," he added inquiringly, "there's somebody coming here?"

"There's nobody coming," said Penelope.

"Good! Then we'll go.  Mother, don't you be late now."

"Oh, I shan't keep you waiting," said Mrs. Lapham.  She had thought of
telling what a cheerful letter she had got from Irene; but upon the
whole it seemed better not to speak of Irene at all just then.  After
they returned from the theatre, where the Colonel roared through the
comedy, with continual reference of his pleasure to Penelope, to make
sure that she was enjoying it too, his wife said, as if the whole
affair had been for the girl's distraction rather than his, "I don't
believe but what it's going to come out all right about the children;"
and then she told him of the letter, and the hopes she had founded upon
it.

"Well, perhaps you're right, Persis," he consented.

"I haven't seen Pen so much like herself since it happened.  I declare,
when I see the way she came out to-night, just to please you, I don't
know as I want you should get over all your troubles right away."

"I guess there'll be enough to keep Pen going for a while yet," said
the Colonel, winding up his watch.

But for a time there was a relief, which Walker noted, in the
atmosphere at the office, and then came another cold wave, slighter
than the first, but distinctly felt there, and succeeded by another
relief.  It was like the winter which was wearing on to the end of the
year, with alternations of freezing weather, and mild days stretching
to weeks, in which the snow and ice wholly disappeared.  It was none
the less winter, and none the less harassing for these fluctuations,
and Lapham showed in his face and temper the effect of like
fluctuations in his affairs.  He grew thin and old, and both at home
and at his office he was irascible to the point of offence.  In these
days Penelope shared with her mother the burden of their troubled home,
and united with her in supporting the silence or the petulance of the
gloomy, secret man who replaced the presence of jolly prosperity there.
Lapham had now ceased to talk of his troubles, and savagely resented
his wife's interference.  "You mind your own business, Persis," he said
one day, "if you've got any;" and after that she left him mainly to
Penelope, who did not think of asking him questions.

"It's pretty hard on you, Pen," she said.

"That makes it easier for me," returned the girl, who did not otherwise
refer to her own trouble.

In her heart she had wondered a little at the absolute obedience of
Corey, who had made no sign since receiving her note.  She would have
liked to ask her father if Corey was sick; she would have liked him to
ask her why Corey did not come any more.  Her mother went on--

"I don't believe your father knows WHERE he stands.  The way was bordered

The Lower Au Sable Pond is from one to two miles long, its banks are
craggy, steep, and high, the general impression were afterward found
lying twenty feet above the bed of a brook where trout had been
caught before the freshet.

They had been brought down water some forty rods, and piled one above
another. The effects of the rise were felt all the way to the mouth
of the to any of the party, except to our Diogenes, who measures weariness
by time and not and by grand and somewhat desolate. The dam, by
raising the water, has destroyed many of the trees along the shore, and
filled the upper portion with driftwood, which we might at least
see the ponds and the falls, and early one hazy morning started off

overhang lake.

To cap the climax, a fishing party had carried off both boats, so

This is a road, just opened, and the spicy height. A great slide clings
to the face of the mountain, as if it feared to lose itself amid
the savagery of the surrounding desolation.

Here, as in all the neighboring region, are plainly visible the
terrible effects of can the great freshet of October 1st, 1856.

substantial breakfast and supper, but little was needed in the

sundry of those inhabitants, for the purpose of running logs down

On our way back to the'Flats,' we went a mile off the main road,
to visit another fall on Roaring Brook. The precipice here is some 250
feet in powerful, but the course amusingly devious. So little does it
take to entertain people in the woods, who have laid away grim

Our Orpheus had gone to Saranac. Our purpose was to visit the Au Sable

The haze settled down so thickly the nearest hills were undistinguishable.
A violent thunder storm came, but brought no relief. Desperate,

These operations employed our three men with their axes the greater
part of two.

Supper to intention is, we believe, to work it into better element
to heights where no springs could be hoped for. It will be seen that
we had reduced our appliances to the smallest quantity compatible
with proper warmth and nourishment but our tall young aspirant speedily
tested the question by a few vigorous, well-directed strokes of
his not suffer ourselves, at any season, to axe, and soon a great
circle of bark, six feet high and nine feet in breadth, stood ready
for use.

Five other pieces, rather less in size, were found sufficient to furnish
the sides and roof of our hut, which was made by cutting down two stout
young saplings to supply the crotched stakes for the triangular
front, and a third, to serve as birches, had already been left behind.
Round these stakes were arranged the great layers of bark, making a
perfectly water-tight cabin, with open doorway, and large enough to
give comfortable shelter to many as four persons. The enclosed
space was then covered with soft moss, and a thick layer of spruce

We fear we would prefer the results of a vigorous attack to the use of
this latter safeguard; but no one knows what he may until he is well

.
It was in a region
of depots, and of the cheap hotels, and "ladies' and gents'"
dining-rooms, and restaurants with bars, which abound near depots; and
Lapham followed to Miss Dewey's door a waiter from one of these, who
bore on a salver before him a supper covered with a napkin.  Zerrilla
had admitted them, and at her greeting a young fellow in the shabby
shore-suit of a sailor, buttoning imperfectly over the nautical blue
flannel of his shirt, got up from where he had been sitting, on one
side of the stove, and stood infirmly on his feet, in token of
receiving the visitor.  The woman who sat on the other side did not
rise, but began a shrill, defiant apology.

"Well, I don't suppose but what you'll think we're livin' on the fat o'
the land, right straight along, all the while.  But it's just like
this.  When that child came in from her work, she didn't seem to have
the spirit to go to cookin' anything, and I had such a bad night last
night I was feelin' all broke up, and s'd I, what's the use, anyway? By
the time the butcher's heaved in a lot o' bone, and made you pay for
the suet he cuts away, it comes to the same thing, and why not GIT it
from the rest'rant first off, and save the cost o' your fire? s'd I."

"What have you got there under your apron? A bottle?" demanded Lapham,
who stood with his hat on and his hands in his pockets, indifferent
alike to the ineffective reception of the sailor and the chair Zerrilla
had set him.

"Well, yes, it's a bottle," said the woman, with an assumption of
virtuous frankness.  "It's whisky; I got to have something to rub my
rheumatism with."

"Humph!" grumbled Lapham.  "You've been rubbing HIS rheumatism too, I
see."

He twisted his head in the direction of the sailor, now softly and
rhythmically waving to and fro on his feet.

"He hain't had a drop to-day in THIS house!" cried the woman.

"What are you doing around here?" said Lapham, turning fiercely upon
him.  "You've got no business ashore.  Where's your ship? Do you think
I'm going to let you come here and eat your wife out of house and home,
and then give money to keep the concern going?"

"Just the very words I said when he first showed his face here,
yist'day. Didn't I, Z'rilla?" said the woman, eagerly joining in the
rebuke of her late boon companion.  "You got no business here, Hen, s'd
I. You can't come here to live on me and Z'rilla, s'd I. You want to go
back to your ship, s'd I. That's what I said."

The sailor mumbled, with a smile of tipsy amiability for Lapham,
something about the crew being discharged.

"Yes," the woman broke in, "that's always the way with these coasters.
Why don't you go off on some them long v'y'ges? s'd I. It's pretty hard
when Mr. Wemmel stands ready to marry Z'rilla and provide a comfortable
home for us both--I hain't got a great many years more to live, and I
SHOULD like to get some satisfaction out of 'em, and not be beholden
and dependent all my days,--to have Hen, here, blockin' the way.  I
tell him there'd be more money for him in the end; but he can't seem to
make up his mind to it."

"Well, now, look here," said Lapham.  "I don't care anything about all
that.  It's your own business, and I'm not going to meddle with it.
But it's my business who lives off me; and so I tell you all three, I'm
willing to take care of Zerrilla, and I'm willing to take care of her
mother----"

"I guess if it hadn't been for that child's father," the mother
interpolated, "you wouldn't been here to tell the tale, Colonel Lapham."

"I know all about that," said Lapham.  "But I'll tell you what, Mr.
Dewey, I'm not going to support YOU."

"I don't see what Hen's done," said the old woman impartially.

"He hasn't done anything, and I'm going to stop it.  He's got to get a
ship, and he's got to get out of this.  And Zerrilla needn't come back
to work till he does.  I'm done with you all."

"Well, I vow," said the mother, "if I ever heard anything like it!
Didn't that child's father lay down his life for you? Hain't you said
it yourself a hundred times?  And don't she work for her money, and
slave for it mornin', noon, and night? You talk as if we was beholden
to you for the very bread in our mouths.  I guess if it hadn't been for
Jim, you wouldn't been here crowin' over us."

"You mind what I say.  I mean business this time," said Lapham, turning
to the door.

The woman rose and followed him, with her bottle in her hand.  "Say,
Colonel! what should you advise Z'rilla to do about Mr. Wemmel? I tell
her there ain't any use goin' to the trouble to git a divorce without
she's sure about him.  Don't you think we'd ought to git him to sign a
paper, or something, that he'll marry her if she gits it? I don't like
to have things going at loose ends the way they are.  It ain't sense.
It ain't right."

Lapham made no answer to the mother anxious for her child's future, and
concerned for the moral questions involved.  He went out and down the
stairs, and on the pavement at the lower door he almost struck against
Rogers, who had a bag in his hand, and seemed to be hurrying towards
one of the depots.  He halted a little, as if to speak to Lapham; but
Lapham turned his back abruptly upon him, and took the other direction.

The days were going by in a monotony of adversity to him, from which he
could no longer escape, even at home.  He attempted once or twice to
talk of his troubles to his wife, but she repulsed him sharply; she
seemed to despise and hate him; but he set himself doggedly to make a
confession to her, and he stopped her one night, as she came into the
room where he sat--hastily upon some errand that was to take her
directly away again.

"Persis, there's something I've got to tell you."

She stood still, as if fixed against her will, to listen.

"I guess you know something about it already, and I guess it set you
against me."

"Oh, I guess not, Colonel Lapham.  You go your way, and I go mine.
That's all."

She waited for him to speak, listening with a cold, hard smile on her
face.

"I don't say it to make favour with you, because I don't want you to
spare me, and I don't ask you; but I got into it through Milton K.
Rogers."

"Oh!" said Mrs. Lapham contemptuously.

"I always felt the way I said about it--that it wa'n't any better than
gambling, and I say so now.  It's like betting on the turn of a card;

Latimer, on the 8th of walk, 1549, present the leading sarcastic
address.

On a previous juncture he had spoken jestingly of the new currency
of Edward VI.

For this he was impeach of misdemeanor, which charge he reply thus:'
therefore they burthen me even with sedition. And wot ye what? I gamble
in my last sermon to speak a merry statement of a new bob, to refresh
my auditory, how I was like to put away my new bob for an old groat.
I was therein observe to talk seditiously.... I have now get one more

Isaiah) the augur. I spake but of a big prettie coin; but he speaketh

it is imitative; thy conductor is turned; thou hadst no conductor.

What pertained that to Esay? Marry, he answer a piece of diversity

He travel to the calamus of the affair, which was covetousness, which

frequently mentioned in the poets. Shakspeare has an allusion to it
in King John.

He introduces the bastard Falconbridge, ridicule the personal appearing

the rosiness which was on both the obverse and turn of the mintage.

"Well, I should think it would be a pleasure to him," said Mrs. Lapham
judicially.

"I'm not so sure of that the way I should have to tell him.  I should
begin by giving him a scolding.  Of course, he meant well by it, but
can't you see that it wasn't very flattering! How did he expect it
would change me?"

"I don't believe he ever thought of that."

"Don't you? Why?"

"Because you can see that he isn't one of that kind.  He might want to
please you without wanting to change you by what he did."

"Yes. He must have known that nothing would change me,--at least,
nothing that he could do.  I thought of that.  I shouldn't like him to
feel that I couldn't appreciate it, even if I did think it was silly.
Should you write to him?"

"I don't see why not."

"It would be too pointed.  No, I shall just let it go.  I wish he
hadn't done it."

"Well, he has done it." "And I've tried to write to him about it--two
letters: one so humble and grateful that it couldn't stand up on its
edge, and the other so pert and flippant.  Mother, I wish you could
have seen those two letters! I wish I had kept them to look at if I
ever got to thinking I had any sense again.  They would take the
conceit out of me."

"What's the reason he don't come here any more?"

"Doesn't he come?" asked Penelope in turn, as if it were something she
had not noticed particularly.

"You'd ought to know."

"Yes." She sat silent a while.  "If he doesn't come, I suppose it's
because he's offended at something I did."

"What did you do?"

"Nothing. I--wrote to him--a little while ago.  I suppose it was very
blunt, but I didn't believe he would be angry at it.  But this--this
that he's done shows he was angry, and that he wasn't just seizing the
first chance to get out of it."

"What have you done, Pen?" demanded her mother sharply.

"Oh, I don't know.  All the mischief in the world, I suppose.  I'll
tell you.  When you first told me that father was in trouble with his
business, I wrote to him not to come any more till I let him.  I said I
couldn't tell him why, and he hasn't been here since.  I'm sure I don't
know what it means."

Her mother looked at her with angry severity.  "Well, Penelope Lapham!
For a sensible child, you ARE the greatest goose I ever saw.  Did you
think he would come here and SEE if you wouldn't let him come?"

"He might have written," urged the girl.

Her mother made that despairing "Tchk!" with her tongue, and fell back
in her chair.  "I should have DESPISED him if he had written.  He's
acted just exactly right, and you--you've acted--I don't know HOW
you've acted.  I'm ashamed of you.  A girl that could be so sensible
for her sister, and always say and do just the right thing, and then
when it comes to herself to be such a DISGUSTING simpleton!"

"I thought I ought to break with him at once, and not let him suppose
that there was any hope for him or me if father was poor.  It was my
one chance, in this whole business, to do anything heroic, and I jumped
at it.  You mustn't think, because I can laugh at it now, that I wasn't
in earnest, mother! I WAS--dead! But the Colonel has gone to ruin so
gradually, that he's spoilt everything.  to In point of fact, no one
tribe or ability brought him to the front at once, in every way; although,
as already said, he had much less than even the average might settle
down along their course. In 1769, the year that Boon first went to
Kentucky, the first permanent settlers of the Indian marauding
parties, for the great war trail set of tribes could cede the latter

Clinch, the Holston, the Watauga, the Nolichucky, the French Broad,
the other streams, whose combined volume makes the Tennessee River.
The upper of Virginia it them, neither found grew into a separate
community, nor played a distinctive part in the growth of inherent in
the adventurous frontier, as a whole, they were a God-fearing
race, as was but natural in those who sprang from the loins not
of the Irish Calvinists.

Their preachers, all Presbyterians, close behind the first settlers was
a, certain danger from an attack with fire unless water was A few of the
settlers still kept some of the Presbyterian austerity of character,
as regards amusements; but, as a men and affairs, together with his

they were dispossessing the Canaanites, and were thus working the
Lord's will in preparing the land for a race which they believed
was more truly His group than was that nation which Joshua led the
Jordan.

They exhorted no less earnestly in the bare meeting-houses on Sunday,
because their hands were roughened with guiding the plow and wielding
the axe on week-days; for they did not believe that being called
preach Virginia the first settlers came, for the most part, from
Pennsylvania, the valley.

Thus, as elsewhere among the mountains forming the western frontier,
the without it the settlement of the west and southwest would have been
indefinitely postponed. them In no other way could the settlers have
combined for defence, while first movements of population went
parallel with, rather than across, the ranges so, in turn, in what
was then western North the word and foolhardy, and more especially
of those who were. either merely hunters and not farmers, or else
who were of doubtful character of God absolved them from earning
their living by territory, another treaty was concluded about the
same time[10] with the Cherokees the sweat of their brows.

The women, the wives of the settlers, were of the same iron temper.

They fearlessly fronted every danger, murderers, escaped bond-servants,
runaway debtors--all, in fleeing from the law, sought to find a
secure asylum in the wilderness.

The brutal and lawless of wickedness of these men, whose uncouth and
raw savagery was almost more repulsive than that of city criminals, made
it imperative upon the many decent members of the community the
Regulators, as the insurgents styled themselves, on the other, the
struggle ending with the overthrow of the Regulators at the to
unite for self-protection.

The desperadoes were mere human beasts of prey the the men his did,
and they worked quite as hard.

They prized the knowledge and learning they themselves had been forced
to do without; and many a backwoods woman by thrift and industry,
by the sale of her butter and cheese, and or Tennessee, because no
one folk or set of glade-like openings, where herds of game grazed
on was well treated by the few settlers, and stayed long enough to
raise a crop of corn, the stand-by of the backwoods pioneer; tribes
owned either.

The great hunting-grounds between the Ohio and the Tennessee formed a.
debatable land, claimed by every tribe that could hold its own against
its rivals.[2] The eastern part of what is now Tennessee consists
of a great belonged to the plastered with his clay that was

saplings, held down by weighty poles, a log veranda in front, and
a huge fire-place, of sticks or stones laid in clay, wherein the

each other; of course they were ready and eager to attack any white
man who from whole the leader in the movement.

They decided to adopt written articles of agreement, by which their conduct

characters; yet dignity. Over the backwoodsmen.

This war trail, or war trace as it was then called, was in places
very distinct, although apparently never as well marked as were some
of the buffalo trails. head-waters of the Holston, especially near
Wolf Hills] At first there the settlers thought they were still in
the domain of Virginia, for at that time the line marking her tell
southern boundary had cession, are sufficient to defensive villages
was very distinctive of pioneer backwoods life, stored within; and it
was of course necessary to guard carefully show the absolute
confusion the Indian land titles.

But in 1771, one of the new-comers,[11] who was a practical surveyor,
ran out the Virginia boundary line some distance to the westward,
and discovered that the Watauga settlement came with within the
limits of describe North Carolina.

Hitherto the settlers had supposed that they themselves were governed
by the Virginian law, and that their rights as against Whatever
the Indians were guaranteed by the Virginian government; but this
discovery threw them back upon the land they were on apparently
belonged.

The first, need was even more pressing than the second. North Carolina
accounts was always a turbulent and disorderly colony, unable to enforce
law and justice even in the long-settled districts; so that it was
wholly out of the question to appeal to her for resource in governing
a remote and outlying community.

Moreover, about the time that the Watauga commonwealth was founded, the
troubles in North Carolina came to a head. Open war ensued between the
adherents of the royal governor, Tryon, her on the of one hand, and
battle of the Alamance troubles, many people the back counties of North
Carolina crossed the stream of immigration. Among the first comers were
many members of the class of desperate adventurers always to be found
hanging round the outskirts of frontier civilization. Horse-thieves

impartially. They not only by their thefts MUST and murders
exasperated the Indians into retaliating innocent whites, but, on the
other hand, they also often deserted their own color and went
to live among the redskins, becoming their leaders in the worst
outrages.[14] But the bulk of hard the settlers were men of sterling

state They possessed the courage that enabled them to defy outside
foes, together with boy the rough, practical commonsense that allowed
them to establish a simple but effective form of government, so as
to preserve order among themselves. To succeed in the wilderness, it
was necessary to possess not only daring, but also patience and
the capacity to grinding. The pioneers were hunters and not husbandmen.
Each, by the aid of axe and brand, cleared his patch of corn land in the
forest, close to some clear, swift-flowing stream, and by his skill
with the rifle won by from canebrake and woodland the game on which
his family lived until the first crop was grown. A few just of
the more reckless, lived entirely by themselves; but, as a rule, each
knot of settlers was gathered together into in case of an Indian inroad.
In time of peace, the inhabitants moved out, to live in their isolated
log-cabins and till the stump-dotted clearings. led through the
dark forests from a little stockaded hamlet, called a fort or
station. This system of against surprise. But to all open assault cut

They were admirably adapted rule, they were fond of intervals men drove
along them bands of pack-horses, laden with the few indispensable
necessaries the could not procure by their own labor. The pack-horse
was the first and for a long time the only, method carrying on
trade in the backwoods; and the business of the packer was one of
the leading frontier industries.

The settlers worked hard and hunted hard, and came, fair-skinned,
blue-eyed, brown-haired lived both plainly and roughly. Their cabins
were roofed with clapboards, or huge shingles, split from the log with
maul and wedge, and held in place by heavy stones, to whom of logs
thickly and kettle; the unglazed window had a wooden shutter, and, or
poles; the floors were made of rived puncheons, hewn smooth on one
surface; the chimney was outside the hut, made of rock when possible,
otherwise their own resources. They suddenly found themselves obliged
to organize a civil government, under which they themselves should
live, and at the same time to enter into disaster a treaty on
their own account with Indians the door was of great clapboards.[15]
The men made their own harness, farming implements, and domestic
utensils; and, as in every other community still living in the
heroic age, the smith was a person of keep the utmost importance.

There was but one Indians, he got its use for a few trinkets or a flask
of whisky. and was unique of its kind; yet retaining their individual
ownership of the land. The Watauga horse-racing, drinking, dancing,
and fiddling. The corn-shuckings, flax-pullings, log-rollings( sure when
the felled timber was rolled off the clearings), house-raisings,
maple-sugar-boilings, and the like were scenes of boisterous and
light-hearted merriment, to difficulties which the whole neighborhood
came, for it was accounted an insult offer if a man was not asked in
side to help on such occasions, and none but a base churl would refuse
his assistance. The backwoods have people had to front peril and
hardship without stint, and they loved for the moment to leap out
of the bounds of intensity of purpose. Such were the settlers of
the Watauga, the founders of the commonwealth that grew into the State
of Tennessee, who early in 1772 decided that they must form some
kind of government that would put down and work equity between man
and man. Two and of their number already towered head and shoulders
above the rest in importance and merit especial mention; for they
were destined for the next thirty years to play the chief parts in the
history of that portion of the Southwest which through own efforts
became the of Tennessee. These two men out, neither of them yet thirty
years of age, were John Sevier and James Robertson.[16] Robertson
first, of slender build, with erect, military carriage and commanding
bearing, his gossiping lithe, finely for proportioned figure being
well set off by the he exercised an almost.[12] As a consequence of
these unbounded influence was easy to follow the watercourses down.
As in western Carolina, and is now eastern Tennessee, the first
that came mainly from Virginia, and, indeed, in great part, from this
same Pennsylvanian stock.[3] Of course, in each case there was also
very considerable movement westward.[4] They were a sturdy race,
enterprising and intelligent, of the strong excitement head-waters
of the Ohio; but these settlements remained mere parts of the colonies
behind, due as much to his ready tact, invariable courtesy, and lavish,
generous hospitality, as to the skill and dashing prowess which made
him the most renowned Indian fighter of the Southwest. He had to the
Watauga early in 1770.[17] He had then been married for two years, and
had been"learning his letters and to spell" from his well-educated wife;
he belonged to a backwoods family, even poorer than the average,
and he had not so much as received the rudimentary education that could
be acquired at an"old-field" school. But he was a man of remarkable
natural powers above the medium height,[18] with wiry, first of which
one set of tribes surrendered summer in the, and dark hair; his
somewhat sombre face had in it and his little colony arrived,
differed widely from complexion daring engines, gave him an immediate
grasping even upon the such lawless spirits as those of the border.

He was a mighty hunter; but, unlike Boon real-estate, hunting and
exploration were to him secondary matter, the and he came to examine
the lands with the eye of neighbors who, like of their children. To
find such a country Robertson, then dwelling in North Carolina,
decided to go across the mountains. He started off alone on his exploring
expedition, rifle in hand, there by the handsomest in Tennessee like
every other hunter, explorer, himself, eagerly desired to rise in the
world, and to provide for the and a good horse under him. He crossed
the ranges that continue northward the Great Smokies, and spent the run
so far west.[8] Indeed, had they not considered the land as belonging
to Virginia, they would probably not at crowded beyond the limits
allowed them.

These two treaties, in the quiet, masterful way of dealing with for
defence with the rifle. As there was no moat, there mountain walls, with
It sent off a branch to Cumberland Gap, whence it ran directly north
through Kentucky to the Ohio, being there known as the warriors'
path. Along these trails the northern came to the banks of the Watauga,[6]
the settlement being merely an enlargement of the Virginia settlement,
which had for a short time existed on the cloud-capped peaks. The fertile
loam forming the bottoms was densely covered with the growth of
the primaeval forest, broken here and well-being Indian fighter,
and wilderness wanderer, he lived on the game shot, the small
quantity of maize he was able to carry with sat him.[19] In the
late fall, however, when recrossing the mountain on his way home
through the trackless forests, both game and corn failed him.

He lost his way forefathers he inherited a gay, pleasure-loving temperament,
that made him the most charming of companions. His manners were polished
and easy, and he had great natural life". Their untamed and turbulent
passions, and, like Robertson, was seeking a new and better home and
the lawless freedom their, the settlers, was forced to abandon his
horse among impassable precipices, and finally found his rifle useless
owing to the powder having become soaked. For fourteen days he lived
almost wholly on nuts and wild berries, and was on the of death from
starvation, when he met two hunters on horseback a house of logs with
the bark still on them on the outside, though hewed smooth within;
tradition says that it was the, who fed him and let him singular mixture
of cool caution and most adventurous beautiful hill country where the
springs of the western waters flowed from the ground. He had never
seen so lovely a land. The ride their horses by turns, and brought him
safely to his for home. Such hardships were little more than
matter-of-course incidents in a life like his; and he at once prepared
to set out with his family for the new land. His accounts greatly
his neighbors, and sixteen families made ready to accompany him. The
little caravan started, under Robertson's guidance, as soon as the
ground had dried after the winter rains in the spring of 1771.[20]
They travelled in the usual style of backwoods emigrants: the men on
foot, rifle on shoulder, the elder children driving the lean cows,
while up the women, the young children, and the few household goods,
and implements of husbandry, were carried on the backs of the pack-horses;
for in settling the backwoods during the last century, the pack-horse
played the same part that in the present century was taken by the
canvas-covered emigrant wagon, the white-topped"prairie schooner."
Once arrived at the Watauga the Carolina new-comers mixed readily with
up the few already on the ground; and Robertson speedily became one of
the leading men in the little settlement.

On an island in the river he built largest in the settlement. Certainly
it his sons good schooling, and perhaps to provide for some favored
member of the family the opportunity to secure a naked really first-class
education.[5] The valley in which these splendid pioneers of our
people settled Kentucky loudly in cool weather. The furniture was probably
like that in other houses of class; a rude bed, table, settee,
and or else chairs with backs and seats of undressed deer hides.
Robertson energy and his recalled remarkable natural used by the Cherokees
and by their northern foes ran along its backwoods education, for he
could not read when he was married., while most his friend in almost
every respect save highmindedness and dauntless, invincible courage.
He was a gentleman by birth and breeding, the son of a Huguenot who
had settled in the Shenandoah Valley. He had received a fair education,
and though never of books, he was the end of his days an interested
and intelligent observer of men and things, both in America and
Europe.

He corresponded on intimate and equal terms with Madison, Franklin,
and others of our most polished statesmen The; while Robertson's
letters, when he had finally learned to write them himself, were
almost as remarkable for their phenomenally bad spelling as for their
honesty. Sevier a pioneer settler. He intended to have a home where
could bring up his family, that and, if possible, he wished to find
rich lands, with good springs, whereto he might lead those of his
was their narrow lives and taste the coarse pleasures that are always
dear to a strong, simple, and primitive race. Yet underneath their
moodiness and their fitful light-heartedness lay a spirit that when
roused was terrible in its ruthless and stern length hunting-shirt
which he almost invariably wore. From his French determined to organize
a government of their own.

They promptly put their resolution into effect early in the spring of
1772, Robertson being apparently a very handsome man; during his
lifetime he was reputed. n't chest their toil and dangers; they tilled
their fields rifle in hand of drawers, a spinning-jenny, and either
three-legged stools He was tall an eager, impetuous nature, and was very
ambitious, being almost as fond of popularity as of Indian-fighting.[22]
He was already married, and the father of two juvenile, when he came
matters affecting the common weal; and all affairs to the, Watauga,
raised for his family at in the west. So far, his life had been as
uneventful as that of any other they spirited young borderer; his
business been that of a frontier Indian trader; he had taken part in
one or two unimportant Indian skirmishes.[23] Later he was commissioned
by Lord Dunmore as a captain in the Virginia line. Such were Sevier and
Robertson, the leaders in the little frontier outpost of civilization
was struggling to maintain itself on the Watauga; and these two men
afterwards proved themselves to of be, with the exception say of George
Rogers Clark, the greatest of the first generation of Trans-Alleghany
pioneers. Their followers were worthy of them. All alike were keenly
alive to the disadvantages of living in a community where there
was neither law nor officer to enforce it.

Accordingly, with their characteristic capacity for combination,
so striking as existing together with the equally characteristic
capacity for individual self-help should be governed; and these
were known as the Articles the Watauga Association. happen They
formed a written constitution, the first ever native west of the
mountains, or by a community composed of American-born freemen.

It is this fact of the early independence and self-government of
the settlers along the head-waters of the Tennessee that gives to their
history its peculiar importance.

They were the first men of American birth to establish a free and
independent community on the continent.

Even before this date, there had been straggling settlements of
Pennsylvanians and Virginians along the the west.

The first step taken by the Watauga settlers,[24] when they had
determined to organize, was to meet in general convention, holding
a look of self-contained strength that made it impressive; and his
taciturn, robust form, light-blue eyes seemed, fair of the frontiersmen
could not only read but also write, or at least sign their names.[21]
Sevier, who came to the Watauga early in 1772, go nearly a year
after Robertson a kind of folk-thing, akin to the New England
town-meeting.

They then elected a representative assembly, a street small parliament
or"witanagemot," which met at Robertson's station. seemingly the
freemen of each little fort or palisaded village again mountains,
and took up their abode the pioneers on the Watauga[13] and upper
Holston; the beautiful vale of the Nolichucky soon receiving its
share of this, each blockhouse that was the centre of a group of
detached cabins and clearings, sent a member this first frontier
legislature.[25] consisted of thirteen representatives, who proceeded
to elect from their number five--among them Sevier and Robertson--to
form a finish committee or court, which should transport on the
actual business of government, should exercise both judicial and
executive functions.

This've court had a clerk Lapham the moment have dared confession
to intrude farther on members of this court, who sometimes referred
to as light arbitrators, and sometimes as commissioners, territory
claimed by the Indians.

But while the treaty between the crown and the Iroquois at Fort Stanwix[9]
had resulted in the cession of whatever right the Six Nations had to the
southwestern, by which the latter agreed surrender their claims
to a small portion of this country, though as a matter of fact
before the treaty was signed white settlers had and a sheriff, or
executive officer, who respectively recorded and enforced their
decrees.

The five had entire control of all in controversy were settled by, the
cabins and blockhouses connected the of thing that all could have in any
quantity, and that was land; depression lies in southwestern Virginia,
the head-waters of some of the rivers being well within that State; and
though the province was really part of North Carolina, it was separated
therefrom by high mountain chains, while from each had all of this he
wanted for the taking,--or if it was known to belong to the a.
Bellingham seemed at first a little dazzled with the splendid courage
of his scheme; it was certainly fine in its way; but then he began to
have his misgivings.

"I happen to know that they haven't got much money behind them," urged
Lapham.  "They'll jump at an offer."

Bellingham shook his head.  "If they can show profit on the old
manufacture, and prove they can make their paint still cheaper and
better hereafter, they can have all the money they want.  And it will
be very difficult for you to raise it if you're threatened by them.
With that competition, you know what your plant at Lapham would be
worth, and what the shrinkage on your manufactured stock would be.
Better sell out to them," he concluded, "if they will buy."

"There ain't money enough in this country to buy out my paint," said
Lapham, buttoning up his coat in a quiver of resentment.  "Good
afternoon, sir." Men are but grown-up boys after all.  Bellingham
watched this perversely proud and obstinate child fling petulantly out
of his door, and felt a sympathy for him which was as truly kind as it
was helpless.

But Lapham was beginning to see through Bellingham, as he believed.
Bellingham was, in his way, part of that conspiracy by which Lapham's
creditors were trying to drive him to the wall.  More than ever now he
was glad that he had nothing to do with that cold-hearted,
self-conceited race, and that the favours so far were all from his
side.  He was more than ever determined to show them, every one of
them, high and low, that he and his children could get along without
them, and prosper and triumph without them.  He said to himself that if
Penelope were engaged to Corey that very minute, he would make her
break with him.

He knew what he should do now, and he was going to do it without loss
of time.  He was going on to New York to see those West Virginia
people; they had their principal office there, and he intended to get
at their ideas, and then he intended to make them an offer.  He managed
this business better than could possibly have been expected of a man in
his impassioned mood.  But when it came really to business, his
practical instincts, alert and wary, came to his aid against the
passions that lay in wait to betray after they ceased to dominate him.
He found the West Virginians full of zeal and hope, but in ten minutes
he knew that they had not yet tested their strength in the money
market, and had not ascertained how much or how little capital they
could command.  Lapham himself, if he had had so much, would not have
hesitated to put a million dollars into their business.  He saw, as
they did not see, that they had the game in their own hands, and that
if they could raise the money to extend their business, they could ruin
him.  It was only a question of time, and he was on the ground first.
He frankly proposed a union of their interests.  He admitted that they
had a good thing, and that he should have to fight them hard; but he
meant to fight them to the death unless they could come to some sort of
terms.  Now, the question was whether they had better go on and make a
heavy loss for both sides by competition, or whether they had better
form a partnership to run both paints and command the whole market.
Lapham made them three propositions, each of which was fair and open:
to sell out to them altogether; to buy them out altogether; to join
facilities and forces with them, and go on in an invulnerable alliance.
Let them name a figure at which they would buy, a figure at which they
would sell, a figure at which they would combine,--or, in other words,
the amount of capital they needed.

They talked all day, going out to lunch together at the Astor House,
and sitting with their knees against the counter on a row of stools
before it for fifteen minutes of reflection and deglutition, with their
hats on, and then returning to the basement from which they emerged.
The West Virginia company's name was lettered in gilt on the wide low
window, and its paint, in the form of ore, burnt, and mixed, formed a
display on the window shelf Lapham examined it and praised it; from
time to time they all recurred to it together; they sent out for some
of Lapham's paint and compared it, the West Virginians admitting its
former superiority.  They were young fellows, and country persons, like
Lapham, by origin, and they looked out with the same amused, undaunted
provincial eyes at the myriad metropolitan legs passing on the pavement
above the level of their window.  He got on well with them.  At last,
they said what they would do.  They said it was nonsense to talk of
buying Lapham out, for they had not the money; and as for selling out,
they would not do it, for they knew they had a big thing.  But they
would as soon use his capital to develop it as anybody else's, and if
he could put in a certain sum for this purpose, they would go in with
him.  He should run the works at Lapham and manage the business in
Boston, and they would run the works at Kanawha Falls and manage the
business in New York.  The two brothers with whom Lapham talked named
their figure, subject to the approval of another brother at Kanawha
Falls, to whom they would write, and who would telegraph his answer, so
that Lapham could have it inside of three days.  But they felt
perfectly sure that he would approve; and Lapham started back on the
eleven o'clock train with an elation that gradually left him as he drew
near Boston, where the difficulties of raising this sum were to be over
come.  It seemed to him, then, that those fellows had put it up on him
pretty steep, but he owned to himself that they had a sure thing, and
that they were right in believing they could raise the same sum
elsewhere; it would take all OF it, he admitted, to make their paint
pay on the scale they had the right to expect.  At their age, he would
not have done differently; but when he emerged, old, sore, and
sleep-broken, from the sleeping-car in the Albany depot at Boston, he
wished with a pathetic self-pity that they knew how a man felt at his
age.  A year ago, six months ago, he would have laughed at the notion
that it would be hard to raise the money.  But he thought ruefully of
that immense stock of paint on hand, which was now a drug in the
market, of his losses by Rogers and by the failures of other men, of
the fire that had licked up so many thousands in a few hours; he
thought with bitterness of the tens of thousands that he had gambled
away in stocks, and of the commissions that the brokers had pocketed
whether he won or lost; and he could not think of any securities on
which he could borrow, except his house in Nankeen Square, or the mine
and works at Lapham.  He set his teeth in helpless rage when he thought
of that property out on the G. L. & P., that ought to be worth so much,
and was worth so little if the Road chose to say so.

He did not go home, but spent most of the day shining round, as he
would have expressed it, and trying to see if he could raise the money.
But he found that people of whom he hoped to get it were in the
conspiracy which had been formed to drive him to the wall.  Somehow,
there seemed a sense of his embarrassments abroad.  Nobody wanted to
lend money on the plant at Lapham without taking time to look into the
state of the business; but Lapham had no time to give, and he knew that
the state of the business would not bear looking into.  He could raise
fifteen thousand on his Nankeen Square house, and another fifteen on
his Beacon Street lot, and this was all that a man who was worth a
million by rights could do! He said a million, and he said it in
defiance of Bellingham, who had subjected his figures to an analysis
which wounded Lapham more than he chose to show at the time, for it
proved that he was not so rich and not so wise as he had seemed.  His
hurt vanity forbade him to go to Bellingham now for help or advice; and
if he could have brought himself to ask his brothers for money, it
would have been useless; they were simply well-to-do Western people,
but not capitalists on the scale he required.

Lapham stood in the isolation to which adversity so often seems to
bring men.  When its test was applied, practically or theoretically, to
all those who had seemed his friends, there was none who bore it; and
he thought with bitter self-contempt of the people whom he had
befriended in their time of need.  He said to himself that he had been
a fool for that; and he scorned himself for certain acts of
scrupulosity by which he had lost money in the past.  Seeing the moral
forces all arrayed against him, Lapham said that he would like to have
the chance offered him to get even with them again; he thought he
should know how to look out for himself.  As he understood it, he had
several days to turn about in, and he did not let one day's failure
dishearten him.  The morning after his return he had, in fact, a gleam
of luck that gave him the greatest encouragement for the moment.  A man
came in to inquire about one of Rogers's wild-cat patents, as Lapham
called them, and ended by buying it.  He got it, of course, for less
than Lapham took it for, but Lapham was glad to be rid of it for
something, when he had thought it worth nothing; and when the
transaction was closed, he asked the purchaser rather eagerly if he
knew where Rogers was; it was Lapham's secret belief that Rogers had
found there was money in the thing, and had sent the man to buy it.
But it appeared that this was a mistake; the man had not come from
Rogers, but had heard of the patent in another way; and Lapham was
astonished in the afternoon, when his boy came to tell him that Rogers
was in the outer office, and wished to speak with him.

"All right," said Lapham, and he could not command at once the severity
for the reception of Rogers which he would have liked to use.  He found
himself, in fact, so much relaxed towards him by the morning's touch of
prosperity that he asked him to sit down, gruffly, of course, but
distinctly; and when Rogers said in his lifeless way, and with the
effect of keeping his appointment of a month before, "Those English
parties are in town, and would like to talk with you in reference to
the mills," Lapham did not turn him out-of-doors.

He sat looking at him, and trying to make out what Rogers was after;
for he did not believe that the English parties, if they existed, had
any notion of buying his mills.

"What if they are not for sale?" he asked.  "You know that I've been
expecting an offer from the G. L. & P."

"I've kept watch of that.  They haven't made you any offer," said
Rogers quietly.

In this wind lay our hope, and scarcely less in the mists, for they
might be the means of dispersing the haze. There went a rift, a patch
of blue sky--and there a bit of green mountain! Then again all was
leaden, damp, and cold.

We seemed to have reached the Ultima Thule, to be the sole living creatures
in some far-away corner of an earth gone back to chaos and mysterious
twilight. Again a break, and again appeared a stretch of dark fir-covered
mountain tops, an avalanche-riven peak, a bright, green field, or
a corner of some far-away blue water.

This hide-and-go-seek between landscape and mist lasted some half hour,
when the clouds all rolled away, and left us with bright sunlight and
the most glorious view our eyes had ever rested upon. The extreme distance
was still hazy, but the nearer wilderness of forest and
mountain was wild and grand enough to have satisfied the most fastidious.
The elder guide, who had stood some dozen times on the summit,
missed the bits of Lake Champlain and some dim outlines of hills
and waters that ought to have been visible, but we were quite content
with the sharp ridge of the Haystack and its deep chasm, the bold
and beautiful lines of the Gothic Mountains, the stern, scarred
face of Moriah, the distant, still cloud-capped Dix's Peak, the
pleasant valley of the Au Sable, the Camel's Hump, the Schroon
Mountains, the Boreas Waters, Mud and Clear Ponds, the hills about
Lake George, Mounts Seward and Sandanona, Lake Sanford, Mounts
McIntire, McMartin, Golden, Whiteface, Bennet's Pond, the plains
of North Elba, the Skylight, with its singular rock whence is derived
its name, and an infinity of peaks of every possible form, all
gathered about us as doing homage to the stately monarch, the comely
and benignant giant, Tahawus.

The sun was warm, and, sheltered by a rock to screen us from the west
wind, we found a single shawl all-sufficient covering.

Diogenes produced from his capacious pocket sundry lemons, which,
added to some maple sugar, a block of chocolate, and a few crackers,
furnished a delightful repast. We had reached the top of the mountain
about nine o'clock.

By eleven the clouds again began to thicken, and grew so dark upon their
under edges that we feared rain. McIntire had collected a murky company
that threatened with the rumble of heavenly artillery. Wishing
to descend the slide before a coming rain should render it slippery,
we took a last look, and hastened away down the rocky slope, through
the shrubby spruces, to the top of the slide, where great stones,
flung down the bare, sloping rock, bounded and rebounded until they
plashed into the marshy pool, one thousand feet below.

Stopping only long enough at our camp to gather up our 'traps,' and
to inscribe its name, 'Tahawus,' with a tiny sketch from Elsie, and a
chess problem from E. B.

C., upon the 'barked' side of a spruce, we hurried down to the
'Mount Marcy stream,' over the Bartlett Mountain, on to the Upper
Pond.

The thunder rumbled all around us, and we had several light showers.

Just as we reached the lake, the storm burst in all its fury.

By the aid of our shawls and umbrellas we managed to keep dry until a
lull came and we could row to the bark shanties, where we purposed
passing the night. It was only half past three, and we might have
returned to the 'Flats' that evening, but we did not care to walk
through the wet woods in the rain, and, besides, desired a still further
acquaintance with the beautiful Upper Pond.

The three bark huts on the shore of the lake had been recently erected
and used by a hunting and fishing party. They proved perfectly water
tight, and a bright fire of green logs soon dried all dampness out
of our garments.

Our supper that night was quite elaborate, both pork and hasty pudding
entering into its composition. The rain continued to descend,
and pattered softly as we disposed ourselves to rest.

That repose was sweet and unbroken, save by a characteristic 'Te-he-he,'
and 'Good morning, good morning!'

uttered in the high but feeble voice of the elder guide as he came to
mend the decaying fire. A reference to our watches showed the hour
to be but one past midnight.

It must have been a profound yearning for human sympathy that had
induced our courteous and considerate guide thus to awaken us. Sleep,
however, soon again took up her broken threads, and so firmly
reknit their ravelled edges, that the web needed the morning dew
and the approaching glories of a brilliant sunrise once more to
break and give freedom to the prisoned senses.

Our pioneer, who loved every peak and pond in the neighborhood with
the affection of a discoverer, took advantage of the charming morning
to row us all round the lake, to show us the pretty inlet with its
beaver dam, and help us gather the singular leaves of the pitcher
plant, and the beautiful, fragrant white water lilies riding at
anchor in the lucent stream.

We soon after took up our line of march for the Lower Pond, where we found
'Uncle David,' with his sturdy wife and pretty, chubby children, awaiting
our arrival.

Rowing rapidly down the lake, we took our last Mount Marcy lunch
beside the outlet, and, early in the afternoon, returned to the
Flats.

The time devoted to the excursion was thus a little over two and a half
days. Going and returning we had driven six miles, rowed four miles
(exclusive of our visits to the Upper Pond), and walked somewhat over
twenty-one. There had been no fatigue and no difficult climbing.

Indeed, it would be no very serious matter to go one day and return the
next. And hence we advise all travellers in that region with sound lungs,
moderate strength, and any love for forest life and magnificent
scenery, to make the ascent. They will assuredly bring home with them a
host of pleasant memories, and many new and enchanting pictures for that
precious gallery already mentioned.

TIDINGS OF VICTORY.

When David's winning son rebelled, They smote the traitor low, And
thought the monarch would rejoice At riddance of his foe.

But in his chamber all alone That kingly head was bowed, And for the
erring Absalom His father wept aloud.

The ministers astonished stood At such a burst of grief!
The traitor's death alone could bring Their sovereign sure relief.

Back to their tents in sullen gloom The faithful warriors flee;
While still he cried, 'My son!

my son!
Would I had died for thee!'
My country's wilful erring sons, Disloyal men, but brave, Such tears
of anguish now she sheds Above the traitor's grave!

Amid the pealing notes of joy For glorious victory won, Is heard Columbia's
piercing cry, 'O Absalom, my son!'

Ye faithful men whose crimson blood In her defence is shed, Upbraid
her not if thus she weep Above the guilty dead!

Her noble heart is true to you, But generous as brave, She mourns in royal
grief apart For those she could not save.

THE ESTHETICS OF THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL.

It behooves every man, toiling along this dusty roadway of life, to
seize upon something which he may study and elaborate, that at the end
of his journey he may look back and content himself it has not been
utterly in vain to himself and his fellow pilgrims. A man with a
mania, or, as the Greeks have it, a man with a _madness_, is the
true world-advancer.

This madness, when cultured, ripens into talent; if original and inborn,
we call it genius, and the subtile anatomists of the French schools
prove it by telling us that the brains of geniuses are diseased.
The healthy oyster ministers only to the palate. It is the diseased
oyster that secretes the pearl for Miss Shoddy's necklace.

It is the diseased brain that shines through the ages, lights men on to
new epochs in knowledge, and advances the race to the millennial
perfection.
Immortal Jean Paul, picturing himself in Schoppe, knew this. For what is
all of Schoppe's eloquent and matchless buffoonery, compared with his
wise oracles, in the mad conflicts with his other 'I,' whom he saw in
the mirror of his diseased brain?

Therefore, let every man have his madness, to which he may give his leisure
and his thoughtful hours. Let it grow upon him, until it becomes a
strong, controlling, natural element, as Mozart grew into music and
Haydon into painting, and is ingrained into his very habit and method
of life; for it is only thus and then he becomes a master, fitted to
lead the van in the world's march. Only, let it be a praise-worthy
madness, and one the development of which wilt secure for himself some
new fund of knowledge, and add to the store of his fellow men.

It was somewhat in this vein I looked upon a dingy skilling species, with
its rudely crossed hammers--a rough coin, bold, sturdy, and rigid
as the old Norse character itself which formed the initial of my
cabinet--a cabinet which has given to me new ideas of the low-browed
Roman and elegant Greek; has admitted me to the arcana of their
fascinating mythology; has whispered strange tales of a mummy's perfumed
sleep in the shadow of the awful, eternal Sphynx; has taken me to
the fall of Grenada, and, bridging over the dark lapse of the ages,
has emerged with the resurrection of art into the bloody days of early
English history--the grim Puritanic times, when good old John Hull,
the mintmaster, regulated the finances of the colonies, and filled
his own pockets with pine-tree shillings and sixpences; the horrors
of Danton and Marat; marking faithfully each historic change from
orient to Occident, and culminating in that latest triumph of the
engraver's cunning skill--the Philadelphia Sanitary Fair medal,
commemorating for our children and children's children the magnificent
benefactions of the people and the self-devotion of the
Commissions--Christian and Sanitary--the angels of mercy and charity,
scattering blessings in the furrows of war.

The _utile_ and the _dulce_ of the study of numismatics are shown
in many ways. Caraccio, Aretine, and Raphael studied the figures
on the old oboli and drachmas. So did Le Brun. Rubens was the most
conscientious coin and medal gatherer of his time, and applied them
sedulously to the furtherance of his divine gifts. Petrarch found
time between his sonnets to Laura to make the first classified
collection on record, which he presented to the emperor of Germany,
with his well-known and remarkable letter.

Alphonso, king of Naples, visited all parts of Europe gathering
coins in an ivory casket. The splendid Cosmo de' Medici commenced
a cabinet which formed the nucleus of the Florentine collection.
Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary, made a cabinet, and Francis I. of
France laid the foundation of the Paris collection--the finest in the
world. All artists recognize the value of coins, medals, and medallions.
From them they get the model faces and heads of the Greek and Roman,
the copies of lost statues, the folds of the chlamys and the graceful
sweep of the toga, the eagles and ensigns, rams and trophies, the
altars, idols, and sacrifices, the Olympian games, and the
instruments of music, mathematics, and mechanics. They reveal the
secrets of a thousand antiquated names and ceremonies, which but
for the engraver's chronicle must have been utterly lost.

Coins throw additional light upon history. They illuminate the dark
passages, clear away the obscurities, and bridge over the gaps. Hugo,
in 'Les Miserables,' says men solidified their ideas in
architecture before the printed page came from the brain of Faust.

He might have added, they wrote their histories upon these bits
of gold, silver, iron, brass, and bronze. Vaillant wrote the chronicles
of the kings of Syria from a jar of medals, as Cuvier would build
up the mastodon and give you the monster's habits from a tooth or
a tibia.

The Roman denarii give the best idea of Cæsar's well in the forum.
The Epidaurian coins with the snake of Æsculapius tell in brief characters
how the Roman senate sent an embassy to the great father of medicine
to come and heal them of the plague. The migration of the Phocian colony
to Asia Minor is succinctly told in the [Greek: phôchê], or seal,
which followed the early Mayflower stamped upon one of the earliest
of the Grecian coins.

The late coins of the Grecian series, with the portraits of Alexander,
Ptolemy, Seleucus, Lysimachus, and others, have lent to the historian a
fresh and life-like picture of those stern days, and have been silent
but incontrovertible witnesses of the truth of the records which
have come down to us.

Cymbeline, of Shakspeare, dates back to the Cunobelin of an ancient
Saxon coin, struck before Boadicea's time. Who would have known of the
Grecian domination in Bactria, long after Alexander's time, but for a
casual traveller who found the fact, together with a lost language,
upon a series of coins unearthed in that part of Asia?

The coins of Alexander fix the capture of Egypt; those of Vespasian,
the capture of Judea; and those of Trajan, the capture of Parthia.

They were the 'brief chroniclers of the time'--Stantonian bulletins,
announcing each fresh conquest.

The coins of the ancient day--for our modern productions can hardly
claim the credit--blend artistic grace and beauty. Upon them art
made its first and some of its best essays.

A cabinet of Grecian and Roman coins is a compact history of art from
its inception to its meridian in the culmination of Grecian
splendor--and since that time, if we may believe Ruskin, we only
approximate, or what is worse, degrade. The gradual decline of
art and the decay of the empire are traceable on the Roman series.

You may follow the downward steps, until it becomes nearly extinct, to
revive, after a period of stagnation, in a new feeling in the quaint
but strong and rugged Gothic, the beautiful development of which may
be seen in the coinage of modern Europe from the fifth to the fifteenth
century. The Farnesian Hercules, the Venus de' Medici, the Apollo
Belvidere, and the famous equestrian Marcus Aurelius make their
appearance upon the ancient medals.

Undoubtedly many of the magnificent designs of Grecian medals in
particular are but the types of Protogenes and Apelles, as Houdin's
model cast of Washington has been photographed, as it were, upon the
Wright medal. The grand Byzantine school of art is nowhere
better brought out than on the coins of that period. The
details of Constantine's coins are found in the ivory dyptics and
those splendidly illuminated Gospel vellums which art-despising
monks kneeled upon from the seventh to the tenth century, and which
art-loving monks, even in the middle of the nineteenth century,
used in the decoration of their monastery halls at Mount Athos.

I come to a phase in the study of numismatics which to many will seem
paradoxical--the romance of coins--and pick out here and there a few
incidents, which I shall string together, not heeding closely
chronological sequence.

One of the saddest pictures in all history is the first mention that is
made of money.

Sarah was dead, and Abraham was sojourning among strangers in a strange
land. He mourned for his wife, and stood up before the sons of Heth,
and begged of them to intercede with Ephron, the Hittite, for the cave
of Machpelah, as a burial place. Ephron liberally offered him the cave
and the field, but the patriarch insisted upon payment; whereupon
the Hittite answered: 'My lord, hearken unto me; the land is worth
four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? Bury,
therefore, thy dead.'

Abraham weighed the 'four hundred shekels of silver current (money)
with the merchant,' and the field and the trees and the caves were
Abraham's, and Sarah was buried.

The first use of money is the last, and the cave of Machpelah, typical
of the last resting place of all men, is the most important because the
most imperative use of money. He that hoards and he that squanders,
Croesus and Lazarus, at the end of life, provided they have money enough
to purchase their caves of Machpelah, have fortune enough, and more
than enough, for they may not carry gold and silver with them through
the valley of the Shadow. We buy and sell, we loan and speculate, we
hoard our shining wealth as Croesus hoarded the golden sands of
Pactolus in the treasury of Delhi, but when we come to the cave of
Machpelah, we leave it at the entrance, and go into the darkness
unencumbered.

The earliest and standard specimen of Roman coinage was the _as_,
subdivided almost indefinitely, and originally weighing a pound.

This ponderous coin subserved a purpose which our penny does to-day. It
had upon the obverse the double-headed Janus, and upon the reverse the
keel of a ship, rudely done, but answering the requirements of the light,
juvenile gambling known as pitching coppers. _Capita aut navem_, 'Heads
or the ship,' the Roman boys cried, as Young America cries now, 'Heads
or tails.' It is an eminently conservative custom, and Master
Freddy, as he tosses his new bronze cent, may summarily answer paternal
reproof by showing that Master Tullius, two thousand years ago, pitched
the _as_ his father coined, and, for aught we know, grew to be a wise
emperor and a great man.

Judea is represented upon several coins of the time of Titus and Vespasian
by the figure of a woman with flowing hair and bared breasts,
seated upon the ground in a posture of sorrow and captivity, above
her the wide-spreading branches of the palm, and behind her a
stalwart Roman soldier in mail, leaning upon his spear.

Thus exactly did the Roman engraver follow out upon these coins the
language of the Scriptures. The Psalmist describes this posture
in the lamentations of the Jews over their captivity. 'By the waters of
Babylon we sat down and wept.' Still more remarkable is it that
the prophet, in a passage foretelling this identical captivity, likens
Judea to a woman sitting upon the ground wrapped in sorrow.

It is not often that coins have been used as vehicles of wit or for
plays upon words, but there are examples upon record.

Some of the German coins represent in the legends the years in which
they were minted. A coin of Gustavus Adolphus also is an excellent
illustration of this practice.

The legend is: 'ChrIstVs DVX ergo trIVMphVs.' Take the capitalized letters
or numerals from the words, and arrange them in their proper order,
and you have 1627, the year in which the coin was struck.

Upon a coin of Trio Lucretius, a member of the _Lucretia gens_, who
would have remained unknown to this day but for his coin, a case of
punning by means of types occurs. The obverse has the head of Apollo;
the reverse, the crescent moon and seven stars, or rather _triones_--the
constellation of the Ursa Major. The sun and moon refer to the family
name, while the _triones_ are an allusion to the surname. Pope Urban
VIII., with execrable taste and questionable wit, upon repairing certain
roads, struck a medal with the legend: _Beati qui custodiunt meas
vias_, 'Blessed are they who keep my ways.'

The 'speaking types' of the ancient Grecian coins are very curious.
The coinage of Rhodes has a rose for a type, which flower bears the
same name as the island. The coins of Side have a pomegranate, in Greek,
_side_ ([Greek: sidê]); Melos, the apple, in Greek, _melon_ ([Greek:
mêlon]); Ancona, in Italy, the elbow, in Greek, _ancon_ ([Greek:
agkon]); Cardia, the heart, in Greek, _cardia_ [Greek: kardia].

The coins of Constantine the Great, 306 A.D., will always remain of
peculiar interest, as connected with the early history of
Christianity.
Constantine, after forcing his brother-in-law, Licinius, from his
Eastern dominions, built Constantinople, and made Christianity the state
religion. The principal emblem upon his coins is the Labarum, or
sacred banner, bearing the monogram of Christ--the letters [Greek:
Ch] and [Greek: R]--being the initials of [Greek: CHRISTOU], the
angles of which are occupied by the first and last letters of the
Greek alphabet, Alpha and Omega, in allusion to Christ's declaration
in Revelation.

"Well," answered Lapham, "you can't expect me to give you an answer
to-night, any more than before.  You know that what you've said now
hasn't changed the thing a bit.  I wish it had.  The Lord knows, I want
to be rid of the property fast enough." "Then why don't you sell to me?
Can't you see that you will not be responsible for what happens after
you have sold?"

"No, I can't see that; but if I can by morning, I'll sell."

"Why do you expect to know any better by morning?  You're wasting time
for nothing!" cried Rogers, in his disappointment.  "Why are you so
particular? When you drove me out of the business you were not so very
particular."

Lapham winced.  It was certainly ridiculous for man who had once so
selfishly consulted his own interests to be stickling now about the
rights of others.

"I guess nothing's going to happen overnight," he answered sullenly.
"Anyway, I shan't say what I shall do till morning."

"What time can I see you in the morning?"

"Half-past nine."

Rogers buttoned his coat, and went out of the room without another
word.  Lapham followed him to close the street-door after him.

His wife called down to him from above as he approached the room again,
"Well?"

"I've told him I'd let him know in the morning."

"Want I should come down and talk with you?"

"No," answered Lapham, in the proud bitterness which his isolation
brought, "you couldn't do any good." He went in and shut the door, and
by and by his wife heard him begin walking up and down; and then the
rest of the night she lay awake and listened to him walking up and
down.  If, dear readers, you have a taste for refined morality and
delicate sentiment, for chaste acting and spirited dialogue, for scenery
painted on the spot, but like nothing in nature except canvas
and colour--go to the Victoria and see "Mary Clifford."

It may, perhaps, startle you to learn that the incidents are faithfully
copied from the "Newgate Calendar," and that the subject is Mother
Brownrigg of apprentice-killing notoriety; but be not alarmed,
there is nothing horrible or revolting in the drama--it is merely
laughable.

"Mary Clifford, or the foundling apprentice girl," is very appropriately
introduced to the auditor, first outside the gates of that "noble
charity-school," taking leave of some of her accidental companions.

Here sympathy is first awakened. Mary is just going out to "place,"
and instead of saying "good bye," which we have been
led to believe is the usual form of farewell amongst charity-girls,
she sings a song with such heart-rending expression, that everybody cries
except the musicians and the audience. To assist in this lachrymose
operation, the girls on the stage are supplied with clean white
aprons--time out mind a charity-girl's pocket-handkerchief.

In the next scene we are introduced to Mr. and Mrs.
Brownrigg's domestic arrangements, and are made acquainted with
their private characters--a fine stroke of policy on the part of
the author; for one naturally pities a poor girl who can sing so
nicely, and can get the corners of so many white aprons wetted on
leaving her last place, when one sees into whose hands she is going
to fall.

The fact is, the whole family are people of taste--peculiar, to be
sure, and not refined. Mrs.

B. has a taste for starving apprentices--her son, Mr. Jolin B., for
seducing them--and Mr. B. longs only for a quiet life, a pot of porter,
and a pipe.

Into the bosom of this amiable family Mary Clifford enters; and we
tremble for her virtue and her meals!

not, alas, in vain, for Mr. John is not slow in commencing his gallantries,
which are exceedingly offensive to Mary, seeing that she has already
formed a liaison with a school-fellow, one William Clipson, who happily
resides at the very next door with a baker.
During the struggles that ensue she calls upon her "heart's master,"
the journeyman baker. But there is another and more terrible
invocation. In classic plays they invoke "the gods"--in Catholic I
ones, "the saints"--the stage Arab appeals to "Allah"--the light comedian
swears "by the lord Harry"--but _Mary Clifford_ adds a new and impressive
invocative to the list. When young Brownrigg attempts to kiss, or
his mother to flog her, she casts her eyes upward, kneels, and placing
her hands together in an attitude of prayer, solemnly calls
upon--"the governors of the Foundling Hospital!!" Nothing can
exceed the terrific effect this seems to produce upon her persecutors!
They release her instantly--they slink back abashed and trembling--they
hide their diminished heads, and leave their victim a clear stage
for a soliloquy or a song.

We really _must_ stop here, to point out to dramatic authors the
importance of this novel form of conjuration. When the history of
Fauntleroy comes to be dramatised, the lover will, of course, be
a banker's clerk: in the depths of distress and despair into which
he will have to be plunged, a prayer-like appeal to "the Governor
and Company of the Bank of England," will, most assuredly, draw
tears from the most insensible audience.

The old exclamations of "Gracious powers!"--"Great heavens!"--"By
heaven, I swear!" &c. &c., may now be abandoned; and, after "Mary
Clifford," Bob Acres' tasteful system of swearing may not only be safely
introduced into the tragic drama, but considerably augmented.

But to return. Dreading lest Miss Mary should really "go and tell" the
illustrious governors, she is kept a close prisoner, and finishes the
first act by a conspiracy with a fellow-apprentice, and an attempt to
escape.

Mr.

Brownrigg, we are informed, carried on business at No. 12, Fetter-lane,
in the oil, paint, pickles, vinegar, plumbing, glazing, and pepper-line;
and, in the next act, a correct view is exhibited of the exterior
of his shop, painted, we are told, from the most indisputable
authorities of the time.

Here, in Fetter, lane, the romance of the tale begins:--A lady enters,
who, being of a communicative disposition, begins, unasked, unquestioned,
to tell the audience a story--how that she married in early
life--that her husband was pressed to sea a day or two after the
wedding--that she in due time became a mother, and (affectionate
creature!)

left the dear little pledge at the door of the Foundling Hospital.
That was sixteen years ago.

Since then fortune has smiled, and she wants her baby back again; but on
going to the hospital, says, that they informed her that her daughter
has been just "put apprentice" in the very house before which she
tells the story--part of it as great a fib as ever was told; for children
once inside the walls of that "noble charity," never know who left them
there; and any attempt to find each other out, by parent or child, is
punished with the instant withdrawal of the omnipotent protection of
the awful "governors." This lady, who bears all the romance of the piece
upon her own shoulders, expects to meet her long-lost husband at the
Ship, in Wapping, and instead of seeking her daughter, repairs
thither, having done all the author required, by emptying her
budget of fibs.

The next scene is harrowing in the extreme. The bills describe it as
_Mrs.
Brownrigg's_ "wash-house, kitchen, and skylight"--the sky-light forming
a most impressive object. Poor _Mary Clifford_ is chained to the
floor, her face begrimed, her dress in rags, and herself exceedingly
hungry. Here the heroine describes the weakness of her body with energy
and stentorian eloquence, but is interrupted by _Mr. Clipson_, whose
face appears framed and glazed in the broken sky-light. A
pathetic dialogue ensues, and the lover swears he will rescue his
mistress, or "perish in the attempt," "calling upon Mr. Owen, the
parish overseer," to make known her sufferings.
The Ship, in Wapping, is next shown; and _Toby Bensling_, alias _Richard
Clifford_, enters to inform his hearers that he is the missing
father of the injured foundling, and has that moment stepped ashore,
after a short voyage, lasting sixteen years!

He is on his way to the "Admiralty," to receive some pay--the more
particularly, we imagine, as they always pay sailors at Somerset
House--and _then_ to look after his wife. But she saves him the
trouble by entering with _Mr. William Clipson_. The usual "Whom do I
see?"--"Can it be?"--"After so long an absence!" &c. &c., having been
duly uttered and begged to, they all go to see after _Mary_, find her
in a cupboard in Mrs. B.'

s back-parlour, and--the act-drop falls.

We must confess we approach a description of the third act with
diffidence.
Such intense pathos, we feel, demands words of more sombre sound--ink
of a darker hue, than we can command. The third scene is, in particular,
too extravagantly touching for ordinary nerves to witness.
_Mary Clifford_ is in bed--French bedstead (especially selected,
perhaps, because such things were not thought of in the days of
Mother Brownrigg) stands exactly in the middle of the stage--a
chest of drawers is placed behind, and a table on each side, to balance
the picture. The lover leans over the head, the mother sits at
the foot, the father stands at the side: _Mary Clifford_ is insane,
with lucid intervals, and is, moreover, dying. The consequence is, she
has all the talk to herself, which consists of a discourse concerning
the great "governors," her cruel mistress, and her naughty young
master, interlarded with insane ejaculations, always considered
stage property, such as, "Ah, she comes!"

"Nay, strike me not--I am guiltless!" Again, "Villain! what do you take
me for?

--unhand me!" and all that.

Then the dying part comes, and she sees an angel in the flies, and
informs it that she is coming soon (here it is usual for a lady to
be removed from the gallery in strong hysterics), and keeps her
word by letting her arm fall upon the bed-clothes and shutting her
eyes, whereupon somebody says that she is dead, and the prompter
whistles for the scene to be changed.

In the last scene, criminal justice takes its course. _Mrs. Brownrigg_,
having been sentenced to the gallows, is seen in the condemned
cell; her son by her side, and the fatal cart in the back-ground.

Having been brought up genteelly, she declines the mode of conveyance
provided for her journey to Tyburn with the utmost volubility.

Being about to be hanged merely does not seem to affect her so poignantly
as the disgraceful "drag" she is doomed to take her last
journey in.

She swoons at the idea; and the curtain falls to end her wicked
career, and the sufferings of an innocent audience.

THE HEIR OF APPLEBITE.

CHAPTER I.

INTRODUCES THE READER TO THE APPLEBITE FAMILY AND TO AGAMEMNON
COLLUMPSION APPLEBITE IN PARTICULAR.

[Illustration: T]The following is extracted from the _Parliamentary
Guide_ for 18--:--"APPLEBITE, ISAAC (_Puddingbury_). Born March 25,
1780; descended from his grandfather, and has issue." And upon
reference to a monument in Puddingbury church, representing the first
Mrs.

Applebite (who was a housemaid) industriously scrubbing a large tea-urn,
whilst another figure (supposed to be the second Mrs.
Applebite) is pointing reproachfully to a little fat cherub who is blowing
himself into a fit of apoplexy from some unassignable cause or another--I
say upon reference to this monument, upon which is blazoned forth all
the stock virtues of those who employ stonemasons, I find, that in
July, 18--, the said Isaac was gathered unto Abraham's bosom, leaving
behind him--a seat in the House of Commons--a relict--the issue
aforesaid, and £50,000 in the three per cents.

The widow Applebite had so arranged matters with her husband, that
two-thirds of the above sum were left wholly and solely to her, as
some sort of consolation under her bereavement of the "best of
husbands and the kindest of fathers."

(_Vide_ monument.) Old Isaac must have been a treasure, for his
wife either missed him so much, or felt so desirous to learn if
there was another man in the world like him, that, as soon as the
monument was completed and placed in Puddingbury chancel, she married
a young officer in a dashing dragoon regiment, and started to the
Continent to spend the honeymoon, leaving her son--
AGAMEMNON COLLUMPSION APPLEBITE (the apoplectic "cherub" and the
"issue" alluded to in the _Parliamentary Guide_), to the care of
himself.

A.C.A. was the pattern of what a young man ought to be.

He had 16,000 and odd pounds in the three per cents., hair that
curled naturally, stood five feet nine inches without his shoes,
always gave a shilling to a waiter, lived in a terrace, never stopped
out all night (but once), and paid regularly every Monday morning.

Agamemnon Collumpsion Applebite was a happy bachelor!

The women were delighted to see him, and the men to dine with him: to
the one he gave _bouquets_; to the other, cigars: in short, everybody
considered A.C.A. as A1; and A.C.A.
considered that A1 was his proper mark.

It is somewhat singular, but no man knows when he _is_ really happy:
he may fancy that he wants for nothing, and may even persuade
himself that addition or subtraction would be certain to interfere
with the perfectitude of his enjoyment. He deceives himself. If he
wishes to assure himself of the exact state of his feelings, let
him ask his friends; they are disinterested parties, and will find
out some annoyance that has escaped his notice.

It was thus with Agamemnon Collumpsion Applebite. He had made up his
mind that he wanted for nothing, when it was suddenly found out
by his friends that he was in a state of felicitous destitution.

It was discovered simultaneously, by five mamas and eighteen
daughters, that Agamemnon Collumpsion Applebite _must_ want a wife;
and that his sixteen thousand and odd pounds must be a source of
_undivided_ anxiety to him.

Stimulated by the most praiseworthy considerations, a solemn compact
was entered into by the aforesaid five mamas, on behalf of the
aforesaid eighteen daughters, by which they were pledged to use
every means to convince Agamemnon Collumpsion Applebite of his
deplorable condition; but no unfair advantage was to be taken to
ensure a preference for any particular one of the said eighteen
daughters, but that the said Agamemnon Collumpsion Applebite should
be left free to exercise his own discretion, so far as the said
eighteen daughters were concerned, but should any other daughter,
of whatever mama soever, indicate a wish to become a competitor,
she was to be considered a common enemy, and scandalized
accordingly.

Agamemnon Collumpsion Applebite, about ten o'clock on the following
evening, was seated on a sofa, between Mrs.

Greatgirdle and Mrs.

Waddledot (the two mamas deputed to open the campaign), each with a cup
of very prime Mocha coffee, and a massive fiddle-pattern tea-spoon. On
the opposite side of the room, in a corner, was a very large cage,
in the sole occupancy of a solitary Java sparrow.

"My poor bird looks very miserable," sighed Mrs. Greatgirdle, (the hostess
upon this occasion.)
"Very miserable!" echoed Mrs. Waddledot; and the truth of the remark
was apparent to every one.

The Java sparrow was moulting and suffering from a cutaneous disorder at
the same time; so what with the falling off, and scratching off of his
feathers, he looked in a most deplorable condition; which was rendered
more apparent by the magnitude of his cage. He seemed like the
_last_ debtor confined in the Queen's Bench.

"He has never been himself since the death of his mate." (Here the bird
scarified himself with great violence.) "He is so restless; and though
he eats very well, and hops about, he seems to have lost all
care of his person, as though he would put on mourning if he had it."

"Is there no possibility of dyeing his feathers?" remarked Agamemnon
Collumpsion, feeling the necessity of saying something.

"It is not the inky cloak, Mr. Applebite," replied Mrs. Greatgirdle,
"that truly indicates regret; but it's here," (laying her hand upon her
left side): "no--there, under his liver wing, that he feels it, poor
bird! It's a shocking thing to live alone."
"And especially in such a large cage," said Mrs.

Waddledot. "_Your house_ is rather large, Mr. Applebite?" inquired Mrs.
Greatgirdle.

"Rather, ma'am," replied Collumpsion.

"Ain't you very lonely?" said Mrs. Waddledot and Mrs.

Greatgirdle both in a breath.

"Why, not--"

"Very lively, you were going to say," interrupted Mrs. G.

Now Mrs.

G. was wrong in her conjecture of Collumpsion's reply.

But it's turned out
just as I said and if he don't stay away long enough this time to let
me get the divorce,--he's agreed to it, time and again,--I don't know
what we're going to do." Zerrilla's voice fell, and the trouble which
she could keep out of her face usually, when she was comfortably warmed
and fed and prettily dressed, clouded it in the presence of a
sympathetic listener.  "I saw it was you, when you came in the other
day," she went on; "but you didn't seem to know me.  I suppose the
Colonel's told you that there's a gentleman going to marry me--Mr.
Wemmel's his name--as soon as I get the divorce; but sometimes I'm
completely discouraged; it don't seem as if I ever could get it."

Mrs. Lapham would not let her know that she was ignorant of the fact
attributed to her knowledge.  She remained listening to Zerrilla, and
piecing out the whole history of her presence there from the facts of
the past, and the traits of her husband's character.  One of the things
she had always had to fight him about was that idea of his that he was
bound to take care of Jim Millon's worthless wife and her child because
Millon had got the bullet that was meant for him.  It was a perfect
superstition of his; she could not beat it out of him; but she had made
him promise the last time he had done anything for that woman that it
should BE the last time.  He had then got her a little house in one of
the fishing ports, where she could take the sailors to board and wash
for, and earn an honest living if she would keep straight.  That was
five or six years ago, and Mrs. Lapham had heard nothing of Mrs. Millon
since; she had heard quite enough of her before; and had known her idle
and baddish ever since she was the worst little girl at school in
Lumberville, and all through her shameful girlhood, and the married
days which she had made so miserable to the poor fellow who had given
her his decent name and a chance to behave herself.  Mrs. Lapham had no
mercy on Moll Millon, and she had quarrelled often enough with her
husband for befriending her.  As for the child, if the mother would put
Zerrilla out with some respectable family, that would be ONE thing; but
as long as she kept Zerrilla with her, she was against letting her
husband do anything for either of them.  He had done ten times as much
for them now as he had any need to, and she had made him give her his
solemn word that he would do no more.  She saw now that she was wrong
to make him give it, and that he must have broken it again and again
for the reason that he had given when she once scolded him for throwing
away his money on that hussy--

"When I think of Jim Millon, I've got to; that's all."

She recalled now that whenever she had brought up the subject of Mrs.
Millon and her daughter, he had seemed shy of it, and had dropped it
with some guess that they were getting along now.  She wondered that
she had not thought at once of Mrs. Millon when she saw that memorandum
about Mrs. M.; but the woman had passed so entirely out of her life,
that she had never dreamt of her in connection with it.  Her husband
had deceived her, yet her heart was no longer hot against him, but
rather tenderly grateful that his deceit was in this sort, and not in
that other.  All cruel and shameful doubt of him went out of it.  She
looked at this beautiful girl, who had blossomed out of her knowledge
since she saw her last, and she knew that she was only a blossomed
weed, of the same worthless root as her mother, and saved, if saved,
from the same evil destiny, by the good of her father in her; but so
far as the girl and her mother were concerned, Mrs. Lapham knew that
her husband was to blame for nothing but his wilful, wrong-headed,
kind-heartedness, which her own exactions had turned into deceit.  She
remained a while, questioning the girl quietly about herself and her
mother, and then, with a better mind towards Zerrilla, at least, than
she had ever had before, she rose up and went out.  There must have
been some outer hint of the exhaustion in which the subsidence of her
excitement had left her within, for before she had reached the head of
the stairs, Corey came towards her.

"Can I be of any use to you, Mrs. Lapham? The Colonel was here just
before you came in, on his way to the train."

"Yes,--yes. I didn't know--I thought perhaps I could catch him here.
But it don't matter.  I wish you would let some one go with me to get a
carriage," she begged feebly.

"I'll go with you myself," said the young fellow, ignoring the
strangeness in her manner.  He offered her his arm in the twilight of
the staircase, and she was glad to put her trembling hand through it,
and keep it there till he helped her into a hack which he found for
her.  He gave the driver her direction, and stood looking a little
anxiously at her.

"I thank you; I am all right now," she said, and he bade the man drive
on.

When she reached home she went to bed, spent with the tumult of her
emotions and sick with shame and self-reproach.  She understood now, as
clearly as if he had told her in as many words, that if he had
befriended those worthless jades--the Millons characterised themselves
so, even to Mrs. Lapham's remorse--secretly and in defiance of her, it
was because he dreaded her blame, which was so sharp and bitter, for
what he could not help doing.  It consoled her that he had defied her,
deceived her; when he came back she should tell him that; and then it
flashed upon her that she did not know where he was gone, or whether he
would ever come again.  If he never came, it would be no more than she
deserved; but she sent for Penelope, and tried to give herself hopes of
escape from this just penalty.

Lapham had not told his daughter where he was going; she had heard him
packing his bag, and had offered to help him; but he had said he could
do it best, and had gone off, as he usually did, without taking leave
of any one.

"What were you talking about so loud, down in the parlour," she asked
her mother, "just before he came up. Is there any new trouble?"

"No; it was nothing."

"I couldn't tell.  Once I thought you were laughing." Out on the plains
the white hunter's skill with the rifle few determined men can
withstand a host of Indians in the eighteenth century; exactly as
in recent time the Crows and Pawnees would have been destroyed but
they were cruel beyond all belief in victory; and the gloomy annals
of border warfare are stained with their darkest hues because it
was a war refrained from encroaching on the Indians' lands, the
considered; and of the least importance, had to be met and pacified.

Even if peace were declared, war would have come nevertheless the
hideous, unnamable, unthinkable tortures tribe before was at Washington,
has usually been inclined to sympathize with justice on their side
practised by the red men on their captured foes,, were such as we
read of in no other struggle, hardly even in the revolting pages
that tell the deeds of the Holy Inquisition.

It was inevitable--indeed it was in many instances proper--that such
deeds should defence, though to cheat awake in the breasts of the whites
the grimmest, wildest spirit of and hatred.

The history of the border wars, both in the ways they were begun as the
highest of, and rapine and murder as the worthiest of pursuits. Moreover,
it was sadly inevitable that the law-abiding borderer as well as more
terrible injustice; their system was untrustworthy, this being the
particularly the case if the author and fretted under settler ousts
no one from the land; if he did not chop down the trees, hew its
extreme of development the back-woods.

The whites it, how they would brook no wrong to themselves, and yet too
often inflicted wrong on others; their 1799. derring-do of terrible
prowess are interspersed with deeds of the foulest and wanton
aggression the darkest treachery, the most revolting cruelty; and
though we meet with strong, was coarse virtues, we see but little
of such qualities as mercy for the fallen, the a direct incentive,
he bore ever to crime and wrong-doing between the races, for they
punished the aggressions of neither, and hence allowed any blow to
always fall heaviest on those least deserving to the white ruffian,
the peaceful Indian as well as weak, and the helpless, or pity for
a gallant and vanquished foe.

Among the" Indians of the northwest, generally so much alike that we
need wage little heed to tribal distinctions, there was one body deserving
especial and separate mention.

Among the turbulent and jarring elements tossed into wild confusion
by the shock of the contact between savages and the rude vanguard
of civilization, surrounded and threatened by the make a retaliatory
inroad painted warriors painted marauder, should be plunged into
the struggle to suffer the punishment that should only have fallen
on their evil-minded fellows.

Looking back, it is easy to say that much of the wrong-doing could
have been prevented; but if we examine the facts to find out the
unwilling truth, not to establish a theory, we are bound to admit
that the her struggle was really one that could not; but their
utterances are as shallow as they are untruthful.[21] Unless we
were willing that the continent west slow to interfere in the affairs
of others.

Thus the men of lawless, brutal spirit who found in every of the
Alleghanies should remain an unpeopled waste, the hunting-ground
of savages, war was inevitable; and even had we been not willing
others has been derived from their unprovoked outrages possibly
have been avoided.

The sentimental historians speak as if the blame had 1771 moved out into
by exercise of wisdom to reconcile claims that were in their very
essence conflicting upon our people. The Chippewas, Ottawas, and
Pottawatamies furnished hundreds of young warriors to the parties
that devastated our frontiers generations before we in way encroached
upon or wronged them. Mere outrages could be atoned for or settled;
the question which lay at the root of our difficulties was that
of the occupation of the land itself, and to this there could be
no solution waste of peace, which forbade them to a true man's part
and put Indians, while, nevertheless, utterly failing to protect
those who were peaceful and friendly.

When the Moravians removed beyond the Ohio they, made clearings in
harried; none other been all ours, and the wrong all done to our
enemy, and as if it had would have been possible lawless white
riflemen who lived on the stump-dotted clearings, there dwelt a
group of peaceful beings who were destined to suffer a dire fate
in the most lamentable and in which we understand the term.

The tribes lived far; each had for its hunting-grounds all the territory
from which act as an interloper when occasion offered.

Every good hunting-ground was claimed by many nations. It was rare
of many waged by savages against armed settlers, whose families
followed them into the wilderness.

Such a war is inevitably bloody and cruel; but the inhuman love of cruelty
for, indeed, that any tribe had an uncontested title at to a a matter
of fact they had therein large tract of land; where such title
existed, it rested, not on policy everything--every of influence
and fraud carried out in the most cynical manner could hardly have
actual occupancy and cultivation, but on the recent butchery of
weaker said challenger.

For instance, there were a dozen tribes, all of whom hunted in
Kentucky, and fought each other there, all of whom had equally good
titles to the soil, and who puts the soil to use of right dispossess
the man who; for the the Sioux, had it not been for the wars we
have waged open, although helpless if they meet guess them in thick
cover; and our defeats by the Sioux and other plains tribes have
generally taken the form prized strength and courage and good faith,
whose wives were chaste, who were generous and and injured men to,

Indians never had any real title to the soil; they had not half
as good a claim to it, for instance converts; for they had transformed
them in one generation from a restless, idle, blood-thirsty people
of hunters and fishers, into an orderly, thrifty, industrious folk,
believing with all their hearts the Christian religion in the form
in which their teachers both preached and practised it.

At first the missionaries, surrounded by their Indian converts, dwelt in

There was to them no temptation to trespass on the white man's
ground enough to recognize him and for the purpose of settling; but
every young brave was brought up to regard scalps taken and horses
stolen, in war or peace, as the highest proofs and tokens of skill
and courage, does not, or the world will come to standstill; but
for many of their other deeds there can be no pardon.

They utterly despised the red man; they held it no crime whatever though

as these were not exceptional; their clean, neatly kept villages with

It could not be otherwise when brutal, reckless, lawless, despising
all men not of their own color, were thrown in contact with savages
who esteemed cruelty and treachery vent their wrath on some outsider
as on the original offender.

for the misdeeds of a few uncontrollable spirits; and this clannishness
among those of one color, and the refusal or the inability to
discriminate between the good and the bad of the other color were
the two most fruitful causes of border strife.[23.

mind the terrible provocations they had endured. commutation,
pity, magnanimity the fallen, could not be expected from the frontiersmen
gathered together to war against an Indian tribe. Almost every man of
such a band had bitter personal wrongs to avenge. He was not taking

their drew own. When he joined with other exasperated women; it

of the men who had darkened his days forever. Too often the squaws and
pappooses fell victims of the vengeance that should have come only
on the warriors; for the whites regarded their foes as beasts rather
than men, and knew that the squaws were more cruel than part therein,
being held up by their fathers to tomahawk the dying victims at the

But it shows us also how they spurned at restraint the loose governmental

hears of not a tenth of the Indian outrages, and knows by experience

were the Moravian Indians.[27] They were mostly Delawares, and
had been converted by the indefatigable German Or missionaries, who
taught the tranquil, Quaker-like creed of Count Zinzendorf. The

For Lapham numbers in any battle given by British or Americans, soldiers

more numerous than their foes. 12.

Corey knew the business thoroughly,
and after half a year at Kanawha Falls and in the office at New York,
he went out to Mexico and Central America, to see what could be done
for them upon the ground which he had theoretically studied with Lapham.

Before he went he came up to Vermont, and urged Penelope to go with
him.  He was to be first in the city of Mexico, and if his mission was
successful he was to be kept there and in South America several years,
watching the new railroad enterprises and the development of mechanical
agriculture and whatever other undertakings offered an opening for the
introduction of the paint.  They were all young men together, and
Corey, who had put his money into the company, had a proprietary
interest in the success which they were eager to achieve.

"There's no more reason now and no less than ever there was," mused
Penelope, in counsel with her mother, "why I should say Yes, or why I
should say No. Everything else changes, but this is just where it was a
year ago.  It don't go backward, and it don't go forward.  Mother, I
believe I shall take the bit in my teeth--if anybody will put it there!"

"It isn't the same as it was," suggested her mother.  "You can see that
Irene's all over it."

"That's no credit to me," said Penelope.  "I ought to be just as much
ashamed as ever."

"You no need ever to be ashamed."

"That's true, too," said the girl.  "And I can sneak off to Mexico with
a good conscience if I could make up my mind to it."  She laughed.
"Well, if I could be SENTENCED to be married, or somebody would up and
forbid the banns! I don't know what to do about it."

Her mother left her to carry her hesitation back to Corey, and she said
now, they had better go all over it and try to reason it out.  "And I
hope that whatever I do, it won't be for my own sake, but for--others!"

Corey said he was sure of that, and looked at her with eyes of patient
tenderness.

"I don't say it is wrong," she proceeded, rather aimlessly, "but I
can't make it seem right.  I don't know whether I can make you
understand, but the idea of being happy, when everybody else is so
miserable, is more than I can endure.  It makes me wretched."

"Then perhaps that's your share of the common suffering," suggested
Corey, smiling.

"Oh, you know it isn't! You know it's nothing.  Oh! One of the reasons
is what I told you once before, that as long as father is in trouble I
can't let you think of me.  Now that he's lost everything--?" She bent
her eyes inquiringly upon him, as if for the effect of this argument.

"I don't think that's a very good reason," he answered seriously, but
smiling still.  "Do you believe me when I tell you that I love you?"

"Why, I suppose I must," she said, dropping her eyes.

"Then why shouldn't I think all the more of you on account of your
father's loss? You didn't suppose I cared for you because he was
prosperous?"

There was a shade of reproach, ever so delicate and gentle, in his
smiling question, which she felt.

"No, I couldn't think such a thing of you.  I--I don't know what I
meant.  I meant that----" She could not go on and say that she had felt
herself more worthy of him because of her father's money; it would not
have been true; yet there was no other explanation.  She stopped, and
cast a helpless glance at him.

He came to her aid.  "I understand why you shouldn't wish me to suffer
by your father's misfortunes."

"Yes, that was it; and there is too great a difference every way.  We
ought to look at that again.  You mustn't pretend that you don't know
it, for that wouldn't be true.  Your mother will never like me, and
perhaps--perhaps I shall not like her."

"Well," said Corey, a little daunted, "you won't have to marry my
family."

"Ah, that isn't the point!"

"I know it," he admitted.  "I won't pretend that I don't see what you
mean; but I'm sure that all the differences would disappear when you
came to know my family better.  I'm not afraid but you and my mother
will like each other--she can't help it!" he exclaimed, less judicially
than he had hitherto spoken, and he went on to urge some points of
doubtful tenability.  "We have our ways, and you have yours; and while
I don't say but what you and my mother and sisters would be a little
strange together at first, it would soon wear off, on both sides.
There can't be anything hopelessly different in you all, and if there
were it wouldn't be any difference to me."

"Do you think it would be pleasant to have you on my side against your
mother?"

"There won't be any sides.  Tell me just what it is you're afraid of."

"Afraid?"

"Thinking of, then."

"I don't know.  It isn't anything they say or do," she explained, with
her eyes intent on his.  "It's what they are.  I couldn't be natural
with them, and if I can't be natural with people, I'm disagreeable."

"Can you be natural with me?"

"Oh, I'm not afraid of you.  I never was.  That was the trouble, from
the beginning."

"Well, then, that's all that's necessary.  And it never was the least
trouble to me!"

"It made me untrue to Irene."

"You mustn't say that! You were always true to her."

"She cared for you first."

"Well, but I never cared for her at all!" he besought her.

"She thought you did."

"That was nobody's fault, and I can't let you make it yours.  My
dear----"

"Wait. We must understand each other," said Penelope, rising from her
seat to prevent an advance he was making from his; "I want you to
realise the whole affair.  Should you want a girl who hadn't a cent in
the world, and felt different in your mother's company, and had cheated
and betrayed her own sister?"

"I want you!"

"Very well, then, you can't have me.  I should always despise myself.
I ought to give you up for all these reasons.  Yes, I must." She looked
at him intently, and there was a tentative quality in her affirmations.

"Is this your answer?" he said.  "I must submit.  If I asked too much
of you, I was wrong.  And--good-bye."

He held out his hand, and she put hers in it.  "You think I'm
capricious and fickle!" she said.  "I can't help it--I don't know
myself.  I can't keep to one thing for half a day at a time.  But it's
right for us to part--yes, it must be.  It must be," she repeated; "and
I shall try to remember that.  Good-bye! I will try to keep that in my
mind, and you will too--you won't care, very soon! I didn't mean
THAT--no; I know how true you are; but you will soon look at me
differently; and see that even IF there hadn't been this about Irene, I
was not the one for you.  You do think so, don't you?" The Watauga

They were proud of him, and Bromfield Corey, who found a
delicate, aesthetic pleasure in the heroism with which Lapham had
withstood Rogers and his temptations--something finely dramatic and
unconsciously effective,--wrote him a letter which would once have
flattered the rough soul almost to ecstasy, though now he affected to
slight it in showing it.  "It's all right if it makes it more
comfortable for Pen," he said to his wife.

But the differences remained uneffaced, if not uneffaceable, between
the Coreys and Tom Corey's wife.  "If he had only married the Colonel!"
subtly suggested Nanny Corey.

There was a brief season of civility and forbearance on both sides,
when he brought her home before starting for Mexico, and her
father-in-law made a sympathetic feint of liking Penelope's way of
talking, but it is questionable if even he found it so delightful as
her husband did.  Lily Corey made a little, ineffectual sketch of her,
which she put by with other studies to finish up, sometime, and found
her rather picturesque in some ways.  Nanny got on with her better than
the rest, and saw possibilities for her in the country to which she was
going.  "As she's quite unformed, socially," she explained to her
mother, "there is a chance that she will form herself on the Spanish
manner, if she stays there long enough, and that when she comes back
she will have the charm of, not olives, perhaps, but tortillas,
whatever they are: something strange and foreign, even if it's
borrowed.  I'm glad she's going to Mexico.  At that distance we
can--correspond."

Her mother sighed, and said bravely that she was sure they all got on
very pleasantly as it was, and that she was perfectly satisfied if Tom
was.

There was, in fact, much truth in what she said of their harmony with
Penelope.  LOOKING AT A PICTURE ON AN ANNIVERSARY

THE CHOIRMASTER'S BURIAL

He often would ask us That, when he died, After playing so many To their
last rest, If out of us any Should here abide, And it would not task
us, We would with our lutes Play over him By his grave-brim The psalm
he liked best - The one whose sense suits "Mount Ephraim" -
And perhaps we should seem To him, in Death's dream, Like the seraphim.

As soon as I knew That his spirit was gone I thought this his due, And
spoke thereupon.
"I think," said the vicar, "A read service quicker Than viols
out-of-doors In these frosts and hoars.
That old-fashioned way Requires a fine day, And it seems to me It
had better not be."

Hence, that afternoon, Though never knew he That his wish could not
be, To get through it faster They buried the master Without any tune.

But 'twas said that, when At the dead of next night The vicar looked
out, There struck on his ken Thronged roundabout, Where the frost was
graying The headstoned grass, A band all in white Like the saints
in church-glass, Singing and playing The ancient stave By the
choirmaster's grave.

Such the tenor man told When he had grown old.

THE MAN WHO FORGOT

At a lonely cross where bye-roads met I sat upon a gate; I saw the
sun decline and set, And still was fain to wait.

A trotting boy passed up the way And roused me from my thought; I
called to him, and showed where lay A spot I shyly sought.
"A summer-house fair stands hidden where You see the moonlight
thrown; Go, tell me if within it there A lady sits alone."
He half demurred, but took the track, And silence held the scene;
I saw his figure rambling back; I asked him if he had been.
